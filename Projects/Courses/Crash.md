First, let’s point you in the right direction.

Ambitious people like you and us, we want to become great.

But greatness takes effort, patience, and direction.

    If you’re pointed in the wrong direction, it doesn’t matter how fast you’re traveling. Inversely, if you’re locked on to your desired destination, all progress is positive, no matter how slow you’re going. You’ll reach your goal eventually.

– Shane Parrish, [Principles For Living: An Operating System for Life](https://fs.blog/principles/)

So for those of us who aren’t yet certain which direction we want to point, here are a few key principles to identify.

Forget the pressure to “follow your true passion.”

A lot of people feel this tremendous pressure to “find your one calling,” or “find your true passion” or something you love and build a career around it.

Now, those are great things if you can do it—but early on, that is a monumental task. Most of us just don’t know enough about ourselves (or the kinds of opportunities out there) to pick that “one true path” and plot a perfect course for our whole career.

In rare cases, someone might know from a very young age exactly what they want to do and you know know how to get there but i think that's the exception rather than the rule.

so rather than stressing about picking the one thing you want to go do, i suggest the opposite approach: remove things that you don't want to do.

Think of a Venn Diagram with three overlapping circles:

    stuff you don't hate
    stuff you don't suck at
    stuff that other people value

Where those intersect—the nexus of those three things stuff you don't hate, stuff you don't suck at and stuff valued by others—that's where you want to start. 

Anything within that overlap is fair game. As long as you don’t hate it, don’t suck at it, and it’s valued by others, say “yes” to it early in your career.

Take as many opportunities as you can: jobs, side projects, whatever it might be. Say “yes” to a lot—because that’s the only way you're going to gain enough experience to understand, at a more granular level, the kinds of things you do love.

As you say “yes” to things and get more experience, you’ll start to learn activities you’re not very good at, as well as things you dislike doing, and you’ll add to that list. You’ll narrow down little by little towards a tighter and tighter version of things that are really your sweet spot.

Over 10 or 20 years, or however long it takes (maybe your whole career!), you’ll eventually narrow down to something that is your one true passion.

But don’t start looking for that. Just start with things you don’t hate, things you’re not terrible at and things that other people value.

If an opportunity comes that’s within that overlap, it’s fair game—say “yes” to it and use it as a stepping stone to move forward on your career.

    If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later!

— Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group

-[] List of things you dont hate

<img src="https://crashcontent.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Crashpoint-Career-paths-1024x640.png">

Remember, anything that fits in the overlap of those three things is fair game for a step forward into your career, and you should probably say “yes” to as many things as you can that meet those three criteria.

That’s how you’ll learn to narrow down to your true sweet spot—through trial and error. Add stuff to the “suck at” and “hate” buckets until you’re left with something truly special where you shine, have fun, and get great financial returns.

Example: Jérémy

Hi! Jérémy from Crash here. Crash.co/jeremy I wanted to give you an example of this overlap, so I did the exercise myself.

Things I don’t hate doing:

    Writing
    Creating
    Singing
    Problem-solving
    Figuring stuff out
    Helping people

Things I don’t suck at

    Communicating
    Math & logic
    Graphic design
    Gardening
    Driving

Good communication can be translated to writing things that help people learn—like this very course! (So meta!) Graphic design is a form of creating as well, which I can incorporate into my work.

Now we have our three overlapping bits. I know that if I can find work in which I’m writing and/or designing stuff, I’ll have fun. If that stuff teaches people things, I’ll be really happy.

And I find ways to do that—in fact, one is the page you’re reading right now! I’m writing and designing this article word by word, graphic by graphic, to help you learn how to create a career you will love. And I’m exhilarated to be doing it. And I’m getting paid to do it, on a team I love working with. That’s the ultimate feeling in work!

You can have this too.

How do your two lists line up? Draw lines, circle, color, whatever makes sense to find common ground between things you enjoy and things you’re decent at.

The last step: Stuff other people value

Of course, you gotta get paid—which means figuring out how to marry your “don’t hate/don’t suck at” overlap with stuff other people value enough to pay you to do it.

We don’t understand other people as well as we understand ourselves. Yet, we’re all surprisingly similar. What do you want most? Good food, shelter, fulfillment, much more, right? And the way you achieve these is by working a job, buying a house, buying healthy food, etc.

You‘re addressing your basic needs by making choices on what you spend your time, money, and attention. Well, just like you, other people want the same. And for some, that’s in the form of business.

Now that you’ve found a few potential launching points, it’s time to apply them to what other people value—what a company will be willing to pay you for.

This means understanding how business works a little better than you might currently. A business can be incredibly complex, but any business can boil down to a few key parts:

    Doing something valuable (product/service)
    That you communicate well (messaging/positioning)
    For a specific type of person (customer/market)
    That you find in specific places (channels)
    And charge a fair price (pricing)
    While growing and improving over time (growth)

Every business is trying to do something other people value and will pay money for.

Those businesses also have their own basic needs, which they fulfill by making decisions about their time, money, and attention. Where their decisions meet you—that’s one of your Crashpoints.

In your case, you are the valuable product, and potential employers are your market—which you’ll find in various channels—and you’ll charge a fair price (your salary) to grow and improve over time. See the similarities?

Time to find where you can add value to those companies.

<details><summary>Weigh your options, then take action</summary>

And there is a difference between options and opportunities.

Options are theoretical. Opportunities are actual.

Options are statistical probabilities. Opportunities are singular, concrete instances.

Because options are a giant aggregate of all possible activities, the field will always look better than a specific, individual opportunity. When you know that the field is available to you (in theory), real actions always seem a little less glamorous.

The problem is that the field is not available to you. Your life isn’t like gambling. You can’t pick the field. You have to settle on specific actions.

It’s all right to play with your options and expand them and think about them from time to time. But you’ve got to put options in their place as subordinate, statistical playthings when compared to opportunities.

Options don’t benefit you. Actions do.
Weigh your options, then take action

Of the following career paths you’re about to discover, several may seem exciting. This is a good thing! Remember not to get caught in options-thinking.

Options-thinking can be useful to gain some big-picture, long-term perspective, but it’s a dangerous mindset, too, because it can blind you to opportunities or limit the ways you can gain from them.

When you get stuck analyzing all three options you not only miss out on A and C, but you forgo the benefits of B as well.

When you take opportunity B, it means you can no longer take A or C. That’s the cost.

But the benefit is that you gain whatever goodness is to be had from B—plus, the self-knowledge of how well B suits you. Even if you fail at it, you gain something.

<details><summary>Pick your primary & secondary role types</summary>

Choosing your role types

Once you know your Crashpoints, it’s time to pick a combination of role types to focus your job hunt on. Combinations can look like:

    Sales & marketing
    Marketing & design
    Design & software engineering
    Marketing & customer success
    Customer success & operations
    Sales & operations

or any two you prefer!
Why more than one?

When you’re open to doing other kinds of work just to win a spot at a company, you can actually get hired faster, and then transition into your ideal role. This is how our junior developer Corné crashed into Crash! 😀

He really wanted to become a full-stack software engineer. But, he pitched Crash on doing all kinds of work (a “gopher” role) that included some programming, but mostly non-technical work. Over time, he took on more and more responsibility with our codebase, and now is programming almost 100% of his time at Crash.

Don’t worry about getting “stuck” in a role type. As long as you commit to a growth mindset, TK Coleman explains, you’ll be fine:

Technial [roles](https://youtu.be/vrllBKH1bJY)

Design roles

Design isn’t just about making things look cool. It’s about communicating visually.

Great design is invisible—it gets out of the way, setting the stage for the content and functionality to shine through.

The most common design roles are:

    graphic design, like social media posts and illustrations
    product design, like wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and marketing landing pages
    3D design, like product renderings

If you’ve got an eye for detail, if your favorite brands are beautiful, you might just be a designer.
Remember: You won't get pigeon-holed.

Again, you won't get "pigeon-holed" in your career! Stay playful, curious, and growth-oriented. Test things out and learn by doing. Go 100% all in. Become the type of person who brings excellence on a daily basis. Keep creating value.

TK and Isaac flesh out even more in the two clips below.

Identity what you're willing to be bad at

    Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.

— Winston Churchill

video [here](https://youtu.be/91FQKciKfHI)

Even at our most ambitious, there simply isn’t enough time in your life to become great at everything. For example, as much as I love contributing code to our codebase, I’ll never be a world-class software developer—and I have learned to be okay with that.

The question to ask yourself is, what are you willing to be BAD at?

Scott Belsky (founder of Behance, acquired by Adobe for over $150 million) has a passion: to make the creative world more productive, connected, and adaptive to new technologies.

In this talk, he encourages us to figure out what we need to perform “badly,” so that in other areas we can perform well.

This will prime you to zoom in on your job role type. 😎
