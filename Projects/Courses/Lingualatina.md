To my dismay, learning latin is super easy and knowing a bit of spanish, certainly helps very much. Pronounciation is the easy part and the grammar is super flexible. Vocabulary is just words, but grammar is the brains behind a language. 

Upon analysing the resource that i am using, i find the information be super accurate. Fluency is within the range of 3000 to 5000 words (vocabularly). If i learn 33 words a day, that will take 3 months to learn 3000 words, which is pretty good to reach 80% fluency. Grammar is what gives you structure to be able to combine those words into sentences.

i just realised that watching videos happens to be the slowest way to learn the language, but i need just about every resource i can get. This playlist is just a rough start, but i need something structure, unlike [this](https://mylanguages.org/), which is still helpful.

 Plesidippus Optatus (Optatus is actually the last of some saint in the 4th century, sounds cool, but i'll play safe and use the next one instead), Anno Denomini (just use this one, already has the SEO)
 Pectus pectoris (sounds cool, but the meaning of the words is used to describe a disease, just nah) ,
