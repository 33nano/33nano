> Covid-19 forced the world to change. A global pandemic that brought about a great catastophe for all human beings.

- [x] Manjaro Linux <!-- As a nonchalant distrohopper I had avoided using Manjaro. I knew that it was at the top of the Distriwatch ranking as number one and note recommended than Ubuntu, but I had avoided it because I believed the experience couldn't replace the joy of Ubuntu Budgie and the perfect functionality of Pop OS! Familiarity breeds contempt and it just so happened that I was growing tired of Debian based distros and distrohopping in general. I thought Manjaro would be the distro that would finally let me settle. So, I took a  leap of faith and tried it out. This time around instead of trying what I was familiar with, desktop environments, I figured I would try out the so called community editions. I didn't know what those were and little did I know that I would learn more. I installed the Manjaro awesome edition and it was love on first site. I couldn't believe the performance, the boot time, app launch speed and visual aesthetics; It was absolutely incredible. Manjaro instilled in me confidence and just happened to provide one more step that I needed to take to finally tackle my fear, Arch Linux -->
- [x] Publish an eBook <!-- Thanks to the Reedsy website, I could finally see myself publishing a book. I eventually played around with a number of platforms and finally settled on Google play books. I published my first book Fuck College: How to Unfuck your future on Kindle, Kobo and Google play books -->
- [x] Spreadsheet life management <!-- This was my first encounter with information overload at scale. I honestly believed that spreadsheets alone were enough to manage large sums of information. I spent more time creating spreadsheets than I did any other program or creating notes. I eventually thought it would be a cool idea to put all my favorite sources of information, notes and what not into a single spreadsheet. The result was a multipage, multi colored mess of incoherent information -->
- [x] 500+ Linked connections <!-- I was so obsessed with the idea of reaching 500+ Linkedin connections as if it would magically make me appear more valuable or better.  I was so busy chasing those numbers as if it was a cool reward or achievement that I would get from a game. By unlocking 500+ connections I would update my status progress in this game of connections and do more. It was all a waste when u got banned from the platform. The only way of getting unbanned was submitting my real information, my government issued identity for a digital one. It wasnt worth it and in the end I accomplished nothing -->
- [x] learned about IPFS (web 3.0) <!-- Learning about the decentralized web felt very near and dear to me. It felt like the final piece of the privacy puzzle that I was working on in my life. Interplanetary file system reminded me of my torrenting days and usage of Tor browser. Here was a framework that had properties of the same nature, but I lacked the coding capabilities to harness it -->
- [x] Learned about Block Stack <!-- This was great to learn about because I realized that decentralized applications don't only exist nor are they exclusive to the ethereum blockchain. However... -->
- [x] Purchased Unstoppable Domains (.crypto) <!-- You gotta have ETH in order to do anything -->
- [x] Created a Metamask wallet <!-- Its the first ethereum wallet I ever opened, but I have  doubts. Can consesys be trusted? -->
- [x] Privacy Hardening (privacytools.io) <!-- The breed and butter for privacy conscious individuals -->
- [x] Decentralized blogging (publish0x, beta.cent.io, uptrennd...) <!-- Its a challenge because it doesnt seem like regular articles get any attention. Everyone is focused on Defi, Crypto and developer jargon filled topics -->
- [x] Decentralized music publication (ujo music, audius.co) <!-- I feel like I was scammed by Ujo Music. The platform doesn't exist anymore in 2021. I can't believe I wasted money on it , Audius on the other hand seems like a platform that is here to stay -->
- [x] Decentralized art portfolio (creary...) <!-- Hopefully it doesn't go bust, but honestly decentralized seems like a trigger word to hook people to use s platform just as the term end to end encryption is used -->
- [x] SEO, first page of Google (full name) <!-- I don't have a knowledge panel, but at least my website shows up as the first result -->
- [x] Markdown mastery <!-- Learned and mastered in less than 3 days, heck let's say 10 minutes -->
- [x] 1000+ Following on all platforms <!-- Another useless achievement, but I did it -->
- [x] 1000+ comments Disqus <!-- I got banned from several sites and I got tired of it. Commenting on sites suck. Discord and Reddit are where true community lives, not Disqus or some other commenting system, not even YouTube comments -->
- [x] Manga & manhwa management (33,000+ chapters) <!-- I didn't know I had read that much over the years until I decided to use a dedicated tracker Kitsu and Anilist -->
- [x] PolyIncome <!-- Basically I job hopped the same way I distrohop in search of money. Purely motivated by money and lacking value creation which is the thing that will unlock so many possibilities for me, that I won't even need to be in the warzone known as the USA  (Perry's Steakhouse, Tyson Foods, Whiskey Cake, Doordash, Google Play Books, Burlington, Kindle Direct Publishing, Medium) -->

<details markdown='1'><summary>2021🤓</summary>

- [ ] Custom + Complete Rice Setup (Interplanetary Destinesia) <!-- It all starts with a wallpaper. Once I create a custom wallpaper using one of my photos and Inkscape, you bet I will go rogue. I will even create my own custom icons, custom individual app themes or system, GRUB theme and a whole lot of other stuff -->
- [x] <span style='color:#5dff85;'>**Hugo Blogging Site**</span> <!-- First attempt: I was using netlify and a repository with a github pages environment. The cool thing about it was that I didn't have to convert my markdown files to code. Netlify did all the rendering. Eventually I purchased a domain using NameCheap and I had some issues with Netlify and I was almost out of build minutes for the free plan. Second Attempt: I ditched Netlify altogether and created a new repository with a github pages environment. This time I had to constantly convert my markdown files to code. I jumped around using different themes until I learned about this thing called Lighthouse. It measures the performance of your website. With that amazing extension I settled on the Hugo terminal theme. Eventually I figured out how to automate the Hugo build site process, so the only thing I foucus on is writing markdown -->
- [ ] IPFS site (Hugo) <!-- If I can figure out how to compress whatbi want into a single HTML file, single CSS file and single JavaScript file. Its kinda strict, but that's how it is. -->
- [x] <span style='color:#ff632e;'>**Build a Second Brain**</span> <!-- The reason I am still sane and tranquil today. Information overload and the effects of academic indoctrination are a thing of the past -->
- [ ] Hyperdrive site (Hugo) <!-- Is building a website that can only be viewed by a specialized browser that isn't even famous as Tor a good idea? What will I really gain by creating a hyperdrive website? Isn't an IPFS wbeite enough? -->
- [ ] ~~100 LMMS uploads~~ <!-- I abandoned LMMS so I just canncelled this out instead of commenting it out. If I don't achieve it, I will simply cancel it out for the year, 2021. But going onwards I will simply comment things out -->
- [ ] [Scripting](https://gist.github.com/posener/73ffd326d88483df6b1cb66e8ed1e0bd) with go instead of bash
- [ ] 100 Dribble Portfolio uploads <!-- I just might be able to complete this one once I get into the habit of creating SVG's -->
- [ ] Crash course completion <!-- I should have completed this long time ago, but I find myself procrastinating myself from a better future. This course is the key, Second Brain is the fuel and just do it is the mindset that will propel me forward. What's the worst that could happen? -->
- [ ] Crash mindset full throttle (job landing)
- [ ] Malawi trip <!-- A trip that will force me to reset my life and Brain. I can already feel the tension as the time draws near to the day of my departure. What I had to do financially, reckoning and what I had to prepare, substantial -->
- [ ] Create my own Searx instance <!-- Having your own handy search engine is nice instead of relying on search engines that boast of privacy when they do not. Searx might be the last search engine on Earth that isn't fueled by greed, data harvesting and I'll intentions. Google is evil, duck duck go is the definition of irony - not privacy, Startpage was acquired by a US company thus its values drained with the monetary gains, Ecosia might plant trees, but it sure as hell plants a lot of ads on a simple search - There is absolutely no reason for the first 5 results to be ads, even with an adblocker - ridiculous. When trust cannot be contained by a company, trust in a system or code that is open, opens its way into our minds. -->
- [x] Custom hosts file <!-- My internet addiction remained unaddressed until this very moment. All it took was one simple step of curiosity to find the answer that I had been looking for. It all started when I turned on the advanced settings feature on the uBlock origin extension on my phone. From there I was appointed to the recommended reading which just happens to be a wiki of the official github repository, the code shelter of this amazing content blocker. Throughout my reading I had one question in mind, is it possible to block website using uBlock origin. I had encountered some slight glimpses of some pages not loading and being automatically blocked by the extension. To my curiosity the  process turned out to be very easy and wasnt rocket science. I created my own hosts file using a template from the StevenBlack repository. It was just a simple plaintext file with numbers appended to it. I created a host file and uploaded it to github. With this hosts extension I could finally go about blocking sites that consume my time from comics, YouTube, Reddit and anything that forced my attention. Simply blocking JavaScript from sited wasnt satisfactory. I had Now found something full proof. Eventually I learned that my phone and Linux device had a hosts file as well. I ended up editing the hosts file on my Linux device using vim (/etc/hosts) . I didn't have to worry about updating the hosts file on my android phone because Adaway was managing it. I did find out that the hosts file on my android device is located in the directory (/system/etc/hosts) . All I had to do was add the extension that I had created to my Adaway list. -->
- [ ] Custom GTK3 Theme (Sikidzi) <!-- I am curious about building a GTK theme, but I can't seem to find a good tutorial online. Most of the tutorials are just straight up code tutorials which means I muster the courage to click and clack away at a text editor to get the visual aesthetics I desire. Eventually, I'll just fork a repository or find a template on github that will enable me to just find and replace with my own text, icons, styles and what not -->
- [ ] ~~Flutter Vscodium~~ <!-- Flutter maybe a cool hybrid framework, but I see myself using more go code and gdscript. I don't see myself creating any dart code this year. Mobile apps take more time to build and maintain. I'll continue using VSCodium as my Second Brain, until I can figure out how to do that in vim -->
- [ ] ~~Hangul proficiency for manhwa~~ <!-- my Manhwa addiction is out control, but is that the right term considering the addiction and control are words that don't go together. I need to stop reading Manhwa completely, including the videos that I watch on new chapters. Learning Hangul is cool and definitely a goal for another time, but right now I won't need it, since I won't be using it -->
- [ ] ~~Maxed out cloud storage~~ <!-- I was planning on doing this, but the reality is I am more focused on refining my second Brain and releasing content for the public eye, instead of storing content privately for my archive/dumping purposes. -->
- [x] Markdown everything (book summaries....) <!-- This is blatantly obvious considering the fact that every Duke that I create is a markdown file. I can't get enough of markdown files. I feel like I might exceed the amount of markdown files by 5000 at the end of 2022. That or when I condense all my content into ebooks -->
- [x] Learn & Master Vim <!-- The mental clarity bestowed upon an individual who has become one with vim is a process of tranquility. My neurons flow in a stream of divine consciousness... -->
- [x] Python or Golang name generator with a dictionary of cool words from different languages <!-- What I wanted to create was simply one fork away. I didn't need to create anything from scratch, just build upon and improve a preexisting code solution -->
- [ ] ~~Order 2 mixbooks~~ ( gamedev + Malawi trip) <!-- Converting raster graphics into scalable vector graphics and creating a work of art out of those seem to occupy my mind more than creating and spending money on mix books. If I do spend money on print, its more likely on books that I create using the word, not pictures. One of those books being, Thokozani; a story about gratitude .-->
- [ ] ~~Buy a used Toyota~~ (2021/2022) <!-- Toyota Yaris or the smallest Toyota money can buy. -->
- [ ] ~~Renew license & all bank cards~~ <!-- Patience is a virtue, its too early to renew my license. I'll do that next year, but the rest just maybe -->
- [ ] Apply for US Citizenship <!-- If I fail, the United kingdom shall be my refuge. Honestly though, anywhere but the united states is heaven on Earth. Eurasia -->
- [x] Artix Linux <!-- How did I end up here? Well, I was reading about this thing called systemd and nothing positive was talked about. Calling it daemon would be an understatement, it is a demon, a spawn of the devil incarnate Satan, a beast marked with 666. I still wanted the arch Linux experience without the annoyances of Manjaro. Artix just turned out to be what I had on my plate. -->
- [ ] No PMO/ Celibate/ Sexual <!-- Without a hosts file I would still be losing brain cells and falling deeper into the depths of depression --> Transmutation (Feb  -)
- [ ] 100+ Bash aliases (bashrc)
- [x] 100+ T-UI Launcher aliases <!-- I have so many aliases, I don't even know what some of them do. -->
- [x] Sleep hack (portable rain noise maker $20 - well spent) <!-- My mind was filled with high expectations as I walked into a somewhat unfamiliar store known as bed bath and beyond. I had one simple mission or errand if you will, to simply find some blackout curtains. I knew that , if I bought that my sleep quality would compound. The prices were sky high and I knew I could purchase them elsewhere, so I did just that. However, since I already made this trip, coming back empty handed would only bring emptiness as well. So I explored this store and found something that would become a friend of mine. -->
