 <!-- My finances are in absolute shambles. I thought my previous employer paid weekly as always , but that changed to a fortnight paycheck release. The odds and chances of wage theft are super high... Upon calculating using 4 months as a timeline for my bills, I will only be spending half of what I will be making in 2 and a half months. Assuming the the fortnightly pay is around $600 dollars, my total amounts to $3000, but I barely spend half of that as it goes towards the bills. Even if I made around $800 biweekly a $1000 difference still isn't much. Having a second job is inevitable, but it needs to be the kind with actual benefits and a high pay. I can't afford to be starting from zero when coming back from a vacation. I for sure as hell don't want to work there again - 2 times a charm, next rounds a harm. The question is what the fuck will I do to get second stream of income. My time is limited and the pressure immense. I can't afford to live an average lifestyle when I possess the ability to change it. I haven't even calculated the amount it would take to pay for extra baggage since United started charging $200 for a second bag. I wonder if its possible to withdraw my social security funds early... -->
