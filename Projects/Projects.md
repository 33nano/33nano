<details markdown='1'><summary>Q&A</summary>

1. **How do you structure your projects?**
- I like to think of projects as problems that need to be solved. In the project lies a solution, but with a deadline. Projects are born from a synergy of intellectual resources and the drive to solve a specific problem in ones own life or of another human being. 

2. **What the biggest project that you wish or plan to complete?**
- I would love to build a cross platform gamified brain health application. An application inspired by Neuroscience, various mental models (Kaizen, Gamification...), Second Brain, REBT, Nero linguistic Programming. It helps people learn faster, immediately identify cognitive distortions (outsourced REBT), and do more.

3. **Would you say a bucket list is a project?**
- I believe so. The deadline is death, sounds morbid 

4. **Which project that you are currently working on brings you the most joy?**
- The project that brings me the most joy is the Afropolitan Polyglot. Learning Swahili, Korean , Latin are just the base. I found myself fascinated by words from different languages, I was using them , but it didn't feel quite complete, so learning the languages was inevitable.
