This book is dedicated to my former self, the young boy that used to drown in information and affected by choice paralysis. You have come a long way. Humans are not trees, we have the ability to change every aspect of our lives. This book is also dedicated to every generation, after generation Y, we hold the keys to the future. In order to unlock that future we must learn from the information available at our fingertips. The old way of living is gone, we must pave a new and also save the planet.

I learned from YouTube that catchy titles get you views, so i did the same. We are living in a time when we can agree that everything is better, but thats not the case with the school system, especially college. I feel sympathetic towards young people because school is ruining more lives than diseases, drugs and anything else combined. This book aims to shine a light for those with uncertainty and living in darkness. College is not the only way, you can survive without it.

What The Fuck Is College?

College is the strongest and most popular religion, that has ever been created by human beings. It’s allegiance and worship surpasses, that of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Scientology, Rastafari, Taoism, Buddhism, Shintoism or any other religion combined. College is this sacred place that people attend, either in person or at the comfort of a screen for the sake of attaining salvation. College is a religion that promises a multitude of things like: all your hopes and dreams will become true, you will become richer, you will be guaranteed success, any job you could ever wish for will be yours, you will become famous, your worth as a human being will multiply,you will learn everything there is to know about life, you will become stress free and your life will be easier. The College religion is essential to life, like water because without it, you are nothing and become nothing. Life is difficult as it is, but you know what is more difficult? Not going to College. Whether you meet a person for the first time or have known them for your entire life, it has become almost impossible to not talk about it. When College was created back in the year 1636, the original purpose of it was to provide an alternative for those who were not pursuing religious roles. However, little did they know, that time would eventually transform everything, the purpose would be lost, the objective would be unclear and it would eventually become a religion. College, unlike other religions has a set number of requirements and varies in other parts of the world. College has multiple paths that lead towards acceptance, but one of them surpasses all. They are those who enter this religion by cheating or faking their way into it, using various means, not limited to: bribery, lying on application forms, grade manipulation and so forth. They are those who enter this religion by passing the so called standardized tests that grant these lost souls the rite to passage. Other human beings are able to join this religion through various programs like scholarships, grants, student exchange, international student(study abroad) or financial aid. In some parts of the world this religion is free of charge to its citizens. The ultimate path towards acceptance is through an object created by the government called money. There are those who are able to fund their entire religious experience because they come a from a prestigious background or their parents decide to accept the sacrifice on their behalf. And then we have the rest of the group, people who do not have the monetary resources. There is nothing stopping these people with no money from going to college, who cares about the cost? The future me will be able to pay it off, its just 4 years. They believe everything will be better once they attain salvation from this religion because it prepares you for the near future. When you become one with College, you forget about the fact, that the world is changing at a very rapid pace. When you become one with College, you believe that mistakes are bad and, that successful people don’t make mistakes. When you become one with College, you are taught to fear failure. When you become one with College, you believe that memorizing stuff for the sake of a test is learning. When you become one with College, you believe that all employers require a degree. When you become one with College, you believe that a degree is the only path towards salvation. When you become one with College, you believe that you will automatically get that job you wish for. When you become one with college it is easier to retire. When you become one with College, you believe test taking is a skill that employers care about. When you become one with college you become an employee and die as an employee. When you become one with college you believe you are gaining experience. When you become one with college you can easily rest in peace. When you become one with College, you think you are better than everyone or people in your family who never attended it. When you become one with College,you believe that there is no other alternative. When you become one with College, sleep is not necessary because grades matter more than your health.When you become one with college gaining weight is part of the experience. When you become one with college you become more righteous. When you become one with college you believe you are just as great as the great thinkers of the past or better.When you become one with College, you believe that, what you are memorizing will help you in the real world. When you become one with college teamwork is a sin. When you become one with College, you believe equality exists and, that teachers grade the same without bias. When you become one with College, you believe having the latest textbook edition gives you an advantage. When you become one with College, you believe you will have everything figured out.When you become one with College, you say unto yourself, “memorize,test and graduate.” When you attain salvation/graduate college you are liberated physically, but you are psychologically plagued. The college mindset will haunt you for the rest of your life. You will associate books with torture, math with stress and failure with a letter grade (F). When you graduate you come to the realization, that you don’t know anything. You know nothing and can’t remember anything. Would you call that learning? What is the definition of learning? Why is learning associated with term memory? Why is learning associated with the word application? Congratulations you have graduated, now what? Shouldn’t you use all that knowledge you learned for 4 years and finally apply it. You can do it its easy, you are better than everyone, the world knows of your existence, the world knows you fought hard, the world knows you have experience, the world knows of your skills, the world knows you sacrificed your sleep to gain knowledge, the world knows that you won’t fail because you attained perfection, the world knows your struggle of writing 10 page essays, the world knows of your great public speaking skills, the world welcomes you back to reality, the world is ready for what you bring to the table, the value that you will bestow; The world was in fact waiting for you. Anyone will hire a person without experience and no skills because you have a degree. Everyone is ready to help you because you have so much on your shoulder. The world cares about your debt so much, i think the government and school system will forgive you. Welcome to the future, the only place you can access after college. College gave you all the answers to life. You know what its not your fault; Blame it on your parents because they phyically forced you to go to college, blame it on the governement for not giving you a scholarship or grant, blame it on the economy, why cant they see you have a degree, blame it on your friends, their peer pressure consumed you. Blame your misery of going to college on everyone and everything because you did not have a choice. College was the only way to accomplish my dream. Nothing was going to stop your dreams not even debt, not even regret and not even the notion of death. Your degree is an asset, it signals to the world, I am great, i have skills, i have experience, hire me. Crying is natural and it helps release the pain. The tears will never wipe away the fact that you are still in debt, you dont have everything figured out, you dont have all the answers to life, you dont have any skills, you dont have experience and deep down you regret wasting 4 years of your life that you will never get back. Some people would kill themselves because what is the point of living , if have a limited number of choices weighing you down because of debt and everything else. What has college done to you? It has completed the cycle of mental destruction. It all started back in middle or primary school, then high or secondary school and finally the final piece, the final religion, College/ Higher Learning Institution/ University. You never learned about money, about your mind and you never learned how to apply knowledge because you spent that time accumulating nothing. If college taught you about money,about the mind, real world application of knowledge, equipped you skills and provide the experience, then it would have been an experience worth overlooking the cost. After all, why would you pay or borrow all that money to get an average experience? Buying a car that runs on fossil fuels will get you the same experience as everyone else and may be a couple of cool features tossed in. Buying a car from Tesla give you a totally different experience, more features than most cars,less problems and its essentially worth the cost. Car commercials are funny nowadays because they introduce new features which is great, but those features are already in a Tesla, talk about average. The real person you should blame is yourself because you had two options available. You could have chose the option to be an opt out, a person who does not attend college. You could have chosen to drop out, a person who leaves college for something better. You chose to stay till the end, even though you did not have a strong reason. The world has changed and continues to change. You cannot rely on a system that was invented in 1636 to dictate your life. Just as you can customize your phone to your preferences and every aspect of your life, including where you live; The same should be true for your future. The narrative of assigning the word, future with college is a cognitive distortion. This book will provide you with the answers and the resources to unfuck your future. There is no reason to struggle today when the resources and people are available. The whole College narrative is a cognitive distortion and that term encompasses everything. The term, cognitive distortion, is well articulated when you get to Chapter 4. Chapter 4 is the magical chapter that ties everything together in this book and any information that you will ever come across, from this book onward. You are a few chapters away from a better version of you, please keep reading…

Action Item: Look up the term, unlearn. Unlearning is the first step towards unfucking your future. I recommend completing this action after chapter 4.

Is College The Only Way?

The answer is No! Some people know that and some do not, that is the world we live in. College is optional for most career choices, but it is mandatory for a select few. If you fall into the select few you have 3 options. First option is to close this book and accept your fate because there is no hope left for you. Second option is to keep reading, but preferably skip to chapter 4, 5 and 7. Third option is embark on a journey of discovery because human beings change and what you think you like, might not be true (preferably skip to chapter 4,5 and 7). College or other specialized schools are mandatory, if your career choice or profession cannot be assigned the following keywords:

First keyword: Self-Taught (profession)

Second keyword: Apprenticeship (apprenticed to (profession)

Third keyword: Internship (use case varies. It is not a college graduate exclusive)

Examples: Self-taught programmer, Apprenticed to a carpenter, Interned at Google

Try using those keywords with these professions: Doctor, Lawyer, Nurse, Dentist, Pharmacist, Optometrist, Librarian, Financial Analyst, Astronaut, Chemist, Physicist,Airline Pilot, Neuroscientist.

The professions listed above are some of the select few, but there is more. Chances are you will not find stories of a self-taught doctor, today or any time soon. Try it! You will however, find stories of people with not only those keywords, but they also carry labels like opt out and drop out. Drop outs and opt outs have one thing in common, you can become one too. What drop outs and opt outs have in common is a plan. A plan designed towards a bigger goal , but failure is also part of the equation. If you are afraid of failure your plan will never work out. If that statement strikes fear, do not worry, you are not alone. There is a solution waiting for you in Chapter 4.

Action Item: This step should be executed, after reading Chapter 4. Make a list of 2 famous drop outs and 2 famous opt outs. This will require 4 pieces of paper. Find quotes/words that the person has said or written, that indicate a cognitive distortion. Find new quotes that symbolize a change in thinking. Bonus to you, if you can identify the usage of one or more mental models. What resources and mentors did that person have or use? Why did he/she use those resources? What is it about the language of those resources that made an impact on their Brains language? How long did it take for them to get there? What criticisms did they encounter? After completion, compare the languages. Had these people not done anything about their Brain, would they have ever achieved anything?

Try this exercise on yourself and examine whats holding you back.

Cost of living

Life is expensive, but everyone dreams of the ideal cost of living.The ideal cost of living is not only affordable, but healthy and nearly self sufficient. The ideal cost of living goes something like this…

Home: You own a house whether big or small, this solves the problem of rent. You dont have to settle. You can always just sell that house and buy a new house in a different region. No rent.

Travel: You don’t have to worry about hotels because you have friends and family around the world.

Energy: The roof of your house is completely engulfed in solar panels, you are surrounded by windmills and, if you live near a body of water you have the added advantage of hydroelectric energy. You kill two birds with one stone, no electric bill and no water bill. The added advantage of being near a water source is unlimited water supply, once your filter it of course.

Food: The land your house was built upon is spacious this gives you the advantage of growing your own food. Whats even better is being able to grow any type of food, if you build a greenhouse. A greenhouse has multiple definitions and the pictures speak louder than the words; In my definition, a greenhouse is a controlled farming environment that defies the laws of nature/agriculture. Some foods you still have to buy, but it wont affect the experience. The added advantage of being near a water body is fishing. The most hypothetical situation is having a self driving, remote controlled boat, that runs on renewable energy, equipped with Artificial Intelligence and does the fishing for you. Even better, you have a robot that manages your greenhouse for you equipped with same features as that boat. You just provide the seeds or the fishing bait and the technology does the rest. That’s called imagination and its a cool thing, although that future is near. Automated farming will be the coolest thing, once humans find a way to pull it off.

Transportation: The ideal form of transportation varies with regions.In some places the bus, train, ride sharing systems are advanced and affordable. Some places you can get by with just walking and a bicycle. A motorcycle and electric unicycle are by far the coolest modes of transportation, in my opinion. The ideal form of transportation is not owning a car because its not ideal when you think about insurance, maintenance, inspection, fossil fuels (petrol and diesel), registration, toll roads and traffic tickets, if that ever happens. Actually, having an electric car is probably the most ideal because energy is not a problem. You can have your own charging station and its much more affordable compared to fossil fuel, high carbon emitting machines.

Health: Prevention is better than treatment.Prevention is called primary care and this helps you avoid sickness because of practicing healthy habits. Food is the best medicine. If you have a sore throat, try some ginger mixed with honey, before you ever think of devouring those soul sucking, immunity depraving cough drops. Health is a wide topic, but it comes down to two things because we are talking about the ideal health lifestyle. The first is that pharmaceutical drugs become a necessity in vital situations were food can no longer support the system effectively. The second thing is that its better to travel to another country to seek health care, if you where you currently live is not ideal to do so. Remember this is the ideal health lifestyle.

However,you might be asking, what kind of job can bring to fruition this entire ideal cost of living or some aspects of it? The answer is in Chapter 7.

The ideal cost of living was simply a transition into the main content of this chapter. Parents are among the first people to realize that life is expensive. After all, a person becomes a parent, when they engage in the process of procreation and bring new life into this world. Parents realize that life is expensive not because they were self sufficient, before. They realize that it is expensive because they have to live life for something greater than themselves. Parents must become selfless and not selfish; Its through selflessness that they are able to serve, being selfish has negative consequences. What everyone has to understand is that parents are not against their children’s dreams, no matter how small or big; They are simply concerned about the choices that their children make. Every parent wants their children to be better than them, including rich parents. After all, if your dreams cannot support your life effectively, its important to remember this amazing quote,”Dreams don’t come true, decisions do.” Dreaming of sandwiches will not make them appear in your hands, but if you make the decision to go to Subway or buy the ingredients at a food store, it becomes tangible. The cost of living becomes affordable with the right decisions, but life is not about just being able to afford the cost of living. In order to truly utilize the gift of living, you must ask yourself this question, what do you want to do before you die? If you never thought about this question now is the time and, if you can think about this question everyday, you will appreciate the gift of life to the fullest. If you ever find yourself lost in life and living in denial of death, this question will give you new direction. Cost of living and death make a great combo which leads me to this statement… Death is greater than a college degree. When people die they are not remembered by what college they went to or what degree they possessed. People only remember the greater contributions they made or left behind for humanity. When people continue going to college the cycle of death continues. Death not of the mortal flesh, but of the inner manifestation of the Brain, mankind, self. The cycle of death continues and one very important quote is disregarded. The most important quote that is disregarded is one by a wise man which reads, “The graveyard is the richest place on Earth because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung,the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take the first step, keep with the problem or determined to carry out their dream.” Notice that this quote does not end with or say, “all because someone did not go to college or hindered by the cost of living.” College kills more people than drugs, diseases and anything else combined. People go to college and pay large sums of money to gain nothing. They are awarded a piece of paper and expect something out of it. The cycle of death continues when people go to college.

Action Item: Apart from the question that was previously mentioned, this action step is about having fun and thinking outside the box of living expenses. How much money keeps you alive per month? or if you live with your parents, find out how much they spend. Ask yourself, what would it take to bring the cost down? Consider using online cost of living calculators and Google Earth for this exercise. If you are not sure, dont worry, keep reading, chapter 7 has you covered on this one.

How Your Brain Works

Life is Difficult

This is a statement that everyone in the world can agree with. You can travel all the 195 countries on Earth and the validity of this statement would still hold. You could communicate in all 6500 human languages and the message would still remain; But have you ever asked yourself,why? Why is the statement above true? Keep reading to find out. Before we get to the answer, i have two more questions for you. Have you ever watched a video that inspired or motivated you? Or immersed yourself in a quote, book, podcast, blog ,article and song, that also had that same effect? If yes, you should know by now that all those sources or mediums have one thing in common and that thing is called language. Words like confidence, passion, dreams, focus, persistence are all part of something bigger known as language. Phrases like, follow your dreams,get out of your comfort zone, life is difficult, everything takes time, build your confidence are all part something bigger that we call language. Quotes like, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, are all part of something larger called language. Language is the key to everything in this world. However, the reason why life is difficult is because human beings are bilingual. Yes, you speak 2 languages. The first language, we speak is the one we use to communicate with other human beings, through speaking, writing, listening, reading and even signing. However, humans possess a second language and its through that language, that determines the quality of your life. Life is difficult because we struggle with our second language. This second language should come as no surprise because you are using it right now. That little voice in your head is speaking to you. Its always active 24/7, except in deep states of the mind like sleep,dreaming and meditation. That voice in your head is not out of control, even though it may seem like it. That voice in your head has a language and if you learn it, you not only have the power to control it, but also change your life. Life will not stop being difficult because you need resistance and uncertainty to keep you alive. Without problems in life, living would be a straightforward process(no brainer), but because problems exist we are forced to use our minds to navigate throughout life. If human beings had no problems we would live and die for nothing. If human history was rewritten with no problems being nonexistent then it would be useless to remember all the people in the past who invented things, there would be no wars, there would be no overpopulation and internet would be useless. But because problems exists we are forced to use our minds, adapt to our surroundings or change them instead. However, the reason life is difficult is not because of problems its because of our second language. People give up, use violence and do all sorts of things because of the language of the mind. Giving up on chasing the life you want is the same as committing suicide because humans are capable of doing anything and history is an example of that. Even people born in third world countries or broken homes realize their human potential, compared to some people in first world nations or presigious homes. When you learn the language of your mind, you will have more control over your life, even in situations that are outside the realm of your control. The language of the mind has existed,since the 20th century (1901-2000). The key years for this language of the mind are 1955 and 1970. We are now living in the 21st century(2001-2100) and most people in the world still don’t know about this language. The name of this language is called Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). This book will breakdown NLP in the simplest, most comprehensive and fun way possible.

Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) exists in 3 levels, this is a theory i came up with from synthesizing multiple sources on Brain related topics. I believe this theory to be effective and easy to understand. Hopefully, at the end of this chapter you realize just how amazing the Brain is. If you truly understand this chapter, you will not even need Brain interfaces or Brain chips in the future. Hopefully this theory becomes mainstream and even if someone with fancy credentials steals it away, its for the greater of humanity. Now the reason human beings struggle with the language of the Brain is because most of us out of the current 7.53 billion current world population, operate on a level 1.

NLP Level 1; Cognitive Distortions

Information attained from the website Psych Central

Cognitive distortions are irrational thoughts that distort our perspective of reality. In simple English, they are bad thoughts that affect how we see or view reality or the world around us. There are multiple cognitive distortions, but for the sake of this book i will only highlight fourteen. For each cognitive distortion i will provide multiple examples on a scale of Extreme, typical (normal life) and Academic example.

Emotional Reasoning: You think using your emotions, instead of your thoughts. Your emotions take over your thoughts. You think your feelings are reality

Extreme Example: You cannot contain your sad thoughts (Depression) and decide to take your own life (suicide).

You cannot contain your anger because of what someone did to you on the road and decide to use your car as a weapon, or worse, you have a fire arm in your car.

Divorce, Mass Shooting, etc.

Typical Example: Someone makes you angry and you decide to fuel that anger through your fists (fighting).

You find out that the person was cheating on you and simply using you; You believe beer will take away the emptiness and so you proceed to drink beyond normal.

Academic Example: One test makes you feel like you are worthless.

You take matters into your own hands by fighting a bully or worse killing everyone at school.

Positive rare examples: A musician uses her sadness to make a masterpiece emotional album.

A UFC tighter uses the anger inducing trash talk thrown at him to add more power to his kicks, punches and eventually wins (its not limited to Saiyans)

*Emotional reasoning most of the time has negative effects not just on the body, but on others as well; It weakens the immune system, raises your blood pressure and worse, can cause a heart attack.

Blaming/ Denying: You blame others for your problems or blame yourself when it was not entirely your fault.

Extreme Example:You blame your parents for everything and denying their existence by distancing yourself from them.

Typical Example: Blame something you did on a coworker or taking the blame on their behalf.

Academic Example: You blame college for not teaching you essential topics like money, not finding a job, for your unhapiness, gaining weight, your debt.

Labeling: You mislabel people based on a few qualities or popular beliefs.

Extreme example: Black people are thugs, Middle eastern people are terrorists, white people are mentally unstable. All white people are evil, all women are stupid. America is the best country in the world. Sexism, racism, stereotypes, generic statements with or without facts to back them, insults, assumptions

Typical Example: I assumed or thought you were dangerous. You are racist. You don’t look qualified. My parents dont love me because they never bought me what i wanted.

Academic Example: You can’t make it in life without going to college. If college was free all the world problems would be solved.

Positive Examples: I am the greatest (Muhammad Ali)

Magical Thinking: You think everything will be better when ___ ( you are thinner, smarter, richer, get a new job etc).

Extreme example: typical examples possess the ability of becoming extreme.

Typical example: If i had more money, life would be easier. If i lived in __ country, life would be easier. If i had a boyfriend/girlfriend, i would be happier. I had an Xbox and playstation, i would be happier.

Academic Example: When i get my degree my life will be easier, i will make so much money, anyone will hire me, i will be able to pay off my student debt, everyone will respect me, everyone will think i am smart, i will be famous, my parents will be proud of me, i will never touch a book again, i will travel the world, all my dreams will become true, i will find my purpose, i will have more opportunities, i will learn new things, i will use everything i learned, i will be independent, i will have everything figured out, i will have job security, i will be a better citizen

Fairness: You think things should work out according to what you think is fair.

Extreme example: typical examples possess the ability of becoming extreme

Typical Example: Most of these examples are usually things that are outside of a persons control. Gender equality - equal pay, All men are created equal - systematic racism, injustice, high interest rates. White privilege.

Academic Example: All teachers grade fairly. All degrees are created equal.

Negativity Bias: You notice all the negatives, but fail to notice the positives.

Extreme example: Brainwashed by consuming so much negative news forgetting that there is more to life than what is reported on the news. Focusing on the negative things your parents did to you, but disregarding the mature person you have become.

Typical example: Watching a movie based on a true story, but dwelling on the negatives instead of the final positive outcome. Gossiping about a rude customer, but failing to acknowledge that you still got tipped. Complaining about your package arriving late, even though you still got it.

Academic Example: You only pay attention to all the failing grades and disregard the passing ones.

Catastrophizing/ Cynicism/Magnification; You expect the worst. No matter what you do or plan to do, you always expect bad things to happen.

Extreme example: Afraid of missing a connecting flight, Expecting to get into a car accident because your friend is a crazy driver

Typical Example: Travelling to a foreign country with a friend who is from there (expecting the worst).

Academic Example: Acing a test even though you crammed for it.

Overgeneralizing: Seeing a constant negative pattern based on one event. Somewhat linked to cynicism, but this is more exaggerated or random and extreme.

Extreme example: Always getting rejected and deciding to become lesbian/gay. Failing standardized tests multiple times and thinking you will never make it in life.

Typical example: Getting rejected for multiple job applications and thinking you are not qualified for anything.

Academic Example: Using failure as an excuse to have someone do your homework.

Polarized thinking/ black and white/ All or nothing: Only 2 possible options and no middle ground.

Extreme example: Perfection or complete failure (no average). Positive or negative (no neutral). Rich or poor ( no middle), Heads or tail (no edge). Life or death( no unconsciousness).

Typical example: We are not going to work something out, its either you work in the kitchen or find another job somewhere else, you are not cut out for this position.

Academic example: Either i am good student or bad student (no average).

Double Standard/ Always Being Right: You hold yourself to a higher standard than everyone else.

Extreme example: Argument options for men- do i want to be right or do i want to be happy (from a standup comedian). Women are always right. Adults are always right.

Typical example: I can do it myself. Why should i listen to you?

Academic example: I am a better student why should i work in a group or ask a teacher for help, i can do this myself. Why should i listen to a teacher when i can find the lesson online? The answers on quizlet are always right.

Personalizing: You take things personal.

Extreme example: How dare that person say that to me, i will do something about it. You think this is a joke?

Typical Example: You never showed up to my birthday party, what kind of friend are you?

Academic Example: What would you know? you are just a pathetic teacher. Its just a grade? Its not like parents care, if you fail or pass.

Mind Reading: Assuming you know what other people think.

Extreme example: I know what you are thinking. You don’t know what its like to be poor. I know you want it. I know who you are.

Typical example: You think i am a bad person, don’t you? I can read your mind. You are an open book, so easy to figure out. My friend would have thought of the same thing.

Academic Example: Do you think i am stupid? I know my parents are proud.

Fortune Telling: You predict a positive or negative outcome without thinking about the reality.The fortune telling cognitive distortion is very closely tied to conspiracy theories; One could say they almost go hand in hand, conspiracy theories are the byproduct of fortune telling. Fortune telling is surrounded with doubts because life is uncertain and unpredictable.

Extreme example: I always win first place, therefore i will win first place. I will never get married. No one will ever date me. I will be a failure in the future. I will retire before 30. It never works out. I will live past 100. There is no life in space. Artificial intelligence will take over the world. World war 3 will happen soon.

Typical example: I don’t know, if i can. I can’t do that.

Academic Example: Everyone graduates, therefore i will graduate. You dont have to read to pass the test. College will prepare me for the future.

Should Staments: I Should/Shouldn’t___. Should statements are also linked to other words like must and ought. When people fail to comply with these statements they are occupied by anger, resentment, sadness which is a cruel form of punishment on the self.

Extreme example: I should quit __(addiction).

Typical example:I must stop eating fast food. I should stop playing video games. I should exercise.

College based: I should force myself to study. I should wake up early. I should pay attention in class. I must make my parents proud.

NLP Level 2: Mental Models

Information attained from multiple sources

Mental models are an explanation of someones thought process. Mental models are simply thinking tools that people develop to help guide their thinking. Most mental models come from books, so you have to do more reading to fully grasp them. The feeling and connection of reading a book from start to finish can never be replaced. I know that some of you will settle with audiobooks, a youtube video summary, web article/blog summary, that works out in the interest of time, but i recommend that you read the book , ebook or physical. All quotes are mental models whether they belong in a book or come from someone directly, it takes the language of the mind to piece them together.

Regret Minimization: The richest man in the world uses this technique. He once said, “Its not what you do and mess up, its what you don’t do that will plague you when you are old and looking back on life.” Remember just because he is the richest man in the world, doesnt mean he is a god or less human. The fact that he even says the word regretis powerful. Regret minimization is about doing things in the present moment or finding ways around or out of the things that bind us. If you do what you love and reflect back on life when you are older you, you will have little to no regrets. You will realize that it was better to do what you love than going after that promotion, working more hours, doing stuff you hate, or complaining about being powerless. Regret minimization is a great way to tackle all the cognitive distortionss metioned earlier. Simply by asking yourself, will i regret not doing this when i am older? Is a great way to initiate and go about applying this mental model.

Bucket List : The mental model of a bucket list is simple and is closely related to the regret minimization model. The bucket list mental model is the easiest to understand because it is simply a list of things you want to do before you die. The bucket list interrupts anything that is currently happening in your life by the thought provoking question, What do you want to do before you die? The bucket list mental model has multiple approaches, but i believe a man by the name Ben Nemtin has the the best approach. To undestand this mental model in the fullest sense, i believe his YouTube video does that(TED Talk). The bucket list is a 6 step mental model with full details here.Watching it will have the most impact, but out of generosity i will simply list it out (the list will make more sense if you watch the video, there is no substitute.When you watch the video you will understand why)

1- Reflection: Ask yourself whats important in your life? and what do you want to do?

2- Write it down

3- Talk About your list

4- Be persistent

5- Be audacious

6- Help other people

Law of 33%: The law of 33% is just one out of the 67 steps/mental models by a man named Tai Lopez. The law of 33% is about surrounding yourself with 3 diffrent groups of people. 33% of people who challenge you or are better than you, these become your mentors. Mentors come in different forms such as books, TED talk videos, musicians, artists, people in your profession,smart people, YouTuber, local celebrity. The other 33% with people who are like minded, you share some things in common, these become your friends. 33% of people lower than you. You become their mentor and It makes you feel good about yourself. The law of 33% is about spend 66% of your time with people on a different level than you.

The law of 33 is actually his remix of a concept found in a book called the 10x rule by Grant Cardone.

Backward chaining/Reverse thinking: This mental model is centered on beginning with the end in mind. This is a powerful mental model in that you will find this to be the best way to figure out what you want to do in life. This mental model helps answer that question you were asked when you were young. What do you want to be when you grow up? You can answer this question correctly using this mental model. Lets say your answer was Doctor. The follow up would be, why? If you answered that with because doctors make alot of money and help people, you are wrong. That answer is generic and almost repetitive, like giving a specific function to a robot. However, if your answer is not centered on money or something that everyone else says then you have answered the question correctly. Using this mental the answer to the follow up question would be something like this: I want to find a cure for X disease, i want to become the greatest doctor, i want to conduct research studies and write books, i want to enhance the future of humanity. The reason this mental model is effective is because it gives you a clear goal and solid reason for going after something. Anyone can become a doctor, but if your goal is to simply be an employee, make money and retire, that is an average life. A great doctor is someone who goes beyond the confines of his workspace and office. A great doctor is someone involved in conducting research studies to find cures for diseases, publishing books/medical journals, develop applications that further enhance the field of medicine or regular consumers, makes a TV show. If you say you wan to become ___, what do you hope to achieve in the end? If you cant answer that question with a solid reasoning you can still become that profession, but you will be like most people. I became a doctor, i make good money, but i dont know what to do, i feel like my life is going no where. I am doing the same thing day in and day out. This is a statement that you will come across, if you didnt have the end in mind. Some people will switch careers and are faced with the same barrier. Yes you achieved what you wanted, now what? This mental model is especially useful for someone who is already in college or thinks college is the next logical step. This mental model is well articulated in a book called the 7 habits of highly effective people. Reverse thinking/ begin with the end in mind being habit number 2. The habits of highly effective people provides 7 mental models and i absolutely recommend reading it. The 7 habits of highly effective people was written by Stephen Covey.

Kaizen: This is my favorite mental model because it works all the time, anytime and anywhere. Kaizen is a japanese term meaning continuous improvement or small incremetal improvements. Kaizen is a mental model that conquers fear and gets things done. Kaizen is about taking small steps towards a bigger goal. A good example of kaizen can be well articulated with someone who has never meditated, but wants to start meditating. What most people do when they want to do something is that they take large steps, large actions to go about doing something which never works out. You probably know these people, they went viral, but didn’t know what to do from there. In this instance the person might decide to meditate 30 minutes a day, only to realize that he or she cannot do that consistently. With the kaizen mental model, you would go about meditating just 1 minute per day or 30 seconds a day. This sounds absurd, but it works. 1 minute is not enough, buy you realize that no matter how busy your schedule is you can spare 1 minute. Doing that everyday and sticking to 1 minute you will realize something incredible. You will go for much longer than 1 minute, be happy and the fear will no longer be there. Kaizen is about taking small incremental steps, asking small questions, bestowing small rewards, thinking small thoughts and identifying small moments. To best understand this mental model in the simplest and most fun way possible, i recommend a book called The Kaizen way by Robert Maurer. I believe this book to be the easiest to digest on the topic of Kaizen, than any other sources i have found on the internet. You can try to look it up online, but none of those articles will come as close as that book.

Eat That Frog: This is a mental model on conquering procrastination, but its effects are much more profound. Eat that frog is a mental model derived from a book with the same title by Brian tracy. This mental model was inspired by a story from Mark twain. This mental model focuses on prioritizing your tasks using letters. ABCDE

A- must do, mostly like to procrastinate (serious consequences, if you dont do)

B- Should do (mild consequences, if you don’t do)

C - nice to do (no consequences, whether you do it or not) 50% of people spend time doing this

D- Delegate (something you can give to someone else to do)

E- Eliminate all together (no longer important, habit).

Read the book to get the fuller picture.

Minimalism: Minimalism is more than a mental model, it s a lifestyle. The idea behind minimalism is centered around keeping the essentials and discarding everything else. Some of you might have heard of minimalism before, maybe these names will ring a bell; Fumio Sasaki, Marie Kondo, Leo Babauta, The minimalists- Joshua Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus. Being and becoming a minimalists allows you to have more time, energy, strenghten your connections and clears your mind. Minimalisms allows you unlock true focus unhinged by physical or mental restraints. There are multiple books written on this topic such as Exile lifestyle by Colin Wright, Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life, Goodbye Things, The life changing magic of tidying up. Minimalism is lifestyle and mental model that can unlock true happiness and heal the mind. To find out more there is a documentary on it called Minmalism: A documentary about the important thhings on netflix and you also watch this amazing Youtube video.

Nomad Capitalist: This is more than a mental model, but a lifestyle. To get the fuller message of this model, it can be found in a book called The Nomad Capitalist by Andrew Henderson. This mental model is centered in the message, Go where you are treated best. The nomad capitalist has close association with the term geoarbitrage which is available in a different book, but its a different concept.

Gamification: This mental model is focused on turning everything into a game. A game is a fun and the best medium to learn things because it addresses how we learn. Humans learn by making mistakes and the more mistakes you make the better you get. Inversely the more mistakes you make the better you are at using those experience to play other games flawlessly. Gamification is all about turning and looking at life as a game. You can make learning faster and easier by turning that task into a game. For example, if a language learning game existed you can make as many mistakes as possible and recall it faster than sitting in a classroom or using software. You can turn task completion into a game. You rewards yourself for completing the task and you also level up as a human. The gamification mental model is very powerful in that you could tell a story in a fun way. You could tell people about yourself using gamification or remember the details using this mental model. For example consider the following story. I will be using gamification to tell a story about an individual living in a country in Asia. Game start! I created and customized my character to my liking, but i accidentally picked the starting region to North Korea. North korea is the worst starting region, aside from countries in the African continent because you have to grind for XP. The only skills i managed to work on was stealth, but what could you possibly do with stealth. I looked at my options and the best way to escape was to cross the river becase they cant guard the whole river. I eventually managed to escape North Koreaand flee to South Korea. My character is level 22, his HP has improved, has acquired new skills, and education skill is low. I was able to change my Avatar and username and acquired new DLC’s. My stats keep improving and my paycheck gets autosaved into my account. This was arbitrary, but proves a certain point. The only take away is you can use gamification to remember things easier, learn stuff and do all sorts of things.

Visualization: The effectiveness of this mental model is subjective. This mental model is about visualizing or seeing yourself doing something in the near future. Visualization is often associated with questions like, where do you see yourself in 5 years? Humans by default use visualization because we usually imagine the future being this cool place with high tech everything. We even visualize ourselves basked in all our favorite logo merchandise/stuff. Visualization is great, but it only exists in the mind. Too much visualization becomes daydream and then maladaptive daydreaming. Everyone wants to see themselves exceeding, but if you have a negative image/ label (cognitive distoriton) you visualize bad things. Weirdly enough if you see yourself losing or things going wrong, chances are it will happen, just ask atheletes.

Neuroscience - Neurofeedback…

80/20 Rule (Paretos Principle)

NLP Level 3 :Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)

Information attained from REBT course on Udemy by Dr Paul J Cline

To truly understand REBT, you have to rewind the clock to a time before you were born. Humans beings between the ages 0-8 go through whats known as the imprint period. The imprint period is a very crucial time period in human development because it is during this time that 80% of our personality is developed. From the time you come out of the womb to the time you are 80% of your personality is developed. All the people you were surrounded by, the surroundings and even Television (TV) shape your personality. Who you are, how you act, how you do the things you do, and how you feel most times is the result of that Imprint period. REBT has existed since 1955 and its nothing new. The amount of people who utilize or have heard about it are very few. The human population keeps expanding, but the knowledge of REBT is non existent. REBT is quite the topic among the field of psychology, neuroscience, mental health or any brain related studies. People do not know of REBT, but it needs to be known just as you are aware of cancer, coronavirus, ebola, stroke, heart related diseases, Diabetes and etc. People use REBT, but are unaware of it which is the first real problem. REBT in its full form comprises of the letters ABCDE; each letter has a meaning and explain the thought process. The problem that exists with humanity is that most of us only utilize the first 3 letters ABC. The letters are explained below as follows:

A (Activating Event) - The source, the trigger, the event that initiates the process of thought

B (Belief System)- Hidden Belief System: includes rules, self talk and meaning assigned, since the imprint period.

C (Consequence)- The result, the emotion that is displayed

D (Dispute of Belief System) - A question, change of language or statement that challenges the Belief System to produce E

E (The New Effect)- The better result, better emotion

Thoughts come before feelings. You think and then you feel. Sad thoughts make you feel sad, happy thoughts make you happy, angry thoughts make you angry. When you are thinking of sad thoughts you feel sad. If you continue those thoughts you become depressed. The moment you think of something happy or look at something funny, that sadness seems to magically go away. If you dont like how you feel change your thoughts. This may sound simple because it is, but people struggle because they are unaware or simply dont know that the full equation of the entire letters ABCDE. In the sequence of these letters, the letter B and D are the most important. Below is an example of this simple thought process.

A:Event > B: (Belief System) >C: Consequence (emotion followed by action)

A: Yelled at > B: (hidden) > C: angry and hit that person

A- Someone yells at you. This is the trigger the activating event from the external world perceived by your senses. You seem the the person mouth rambling, your ears are listening to this tone

B (hidden)- This is hidden for a reason and it seems like you cant control this situation. The belief system is automatic. The thought process seems fast and it happens in an instant.

C - You hit that person. This is the consequence. You feel angry and through that anger you released it in the form of a physical attack.

ABC quick recap- yelled at, hidden thinking, angry and hit.

B, the belief system is the things you tell yourself in the moment, the rules you have assigned to that type of scenario and as the meaning behind it. The belief system is a 3 step process. Language or self talk is the first component, Rules are the second step and meaning is the third step. Most of the time this 3 step process was solidified through your imprint period or later on in life. You might having seen something like this happen something on TV, in your parents house or real life. You took that concept and applied to your Brain without realizing it.

This is a common cycle and something that happens quite often among human beings. However, there is a solution and its not rocket science because language is the key to everything. The same scenario could have been handled differently and this is where the letters D and E appear.

A: Activating Event > B: Belief System > C: Consequence (emotion and then action) >

D: Dispute Belief System > E: New Effect

A: Yelled at > B: Self talk + Rules + Meaning > C: Consequence (visualized) >

D: Question + Language change + Counter statement >

E: New effect (better emotion thus better result)

Here is what would have happened had you disputed the belief system.

A- yelled at (activating event)

B- the negative self talk, absorbed rules and assigned meaning

C- You can visualize this outcome and see it unfold, but you can change this part. You have to feel this way and act that way.

D- To dispute B, the belief system you have rewrite the self talk language, assign a new rule/ temporary rule and assign a new meaning/ temporary meaning. This take practice just like anything else and over time it becomes a habit or you can always use it anytime to get the best outcome. To dispute B, belief system you need something that interrupt the process/ unveil the belief system B. Questions, counter statements and language change work the magic. Questions like, is it true? what works out best in the long run? are just a few out of many other questions that make you think before you act. Counter Statements like, “so what if or prove it.”pause your train of thought. The language change happens usually comprises of changing words. The list below indicates word changes. The word on the left being negative and the one on the right having more positivity

Furious - mad ( I am so furious, i can see why you are mad, you are right i think i am mad)

mad- upset (I am so mad, i can see why you are upset, you know what i think i am upset)

upset- challenging ( I am so upset, you are defnitely going to a challenging time, now that you mention it, it is a bit challenging)

*The example above is a scanario between an angry person saying this stuff out loud and the other person simply changes the words and the problem dies down

unbearable - hard

impossible - difficult (Its not impossible its just difficult)

catastrophe - unique situation (You did not have a catastrophe, you just had a unique situation)

problem - challenge (We dont have a problem, we have challenge)

failure - feedback (I am not a complete failure, its feedback )

i am loser - i had a setback ( I am not a loset, i just had a setback)

E- This is the new effect, better result and emotion than what could have happened, had you not disputed your belief system.

Avoid words or phrases like these; I can’t, failure,

When you fully grasp this 3 level NLP model and apply it you will realize 4 things. The first thing that you will realize is that psychotherapists/psychologists are not real doctors. Every psychotherapist/psychologist makes so much money feeding off your weak brain because they already know this stuff and capitalize heavily on this. If psychotherapists/ psychologists found out that people are aware of REBT they would run out of business. However, that wont happen anytime soon because anything brain/mental health related is not something society prioritizes or pay attention to. Humanity would rather pay attention to things like STDS, cancer, corona virus, ebola, influenza, high blood pressure, diabetis, heart attacks, tuberculosis, etc. REBT is just as important, if not more important than those things . A pychotherapist can be trusted however, if they incorporate brain imaging technology in their office. The second thing you will realize is that the feeling of information overload and choice paralysis will be gone. You will come to the understanding and realization that all books, podcasrs, ebooks, audiobooks, blogs, articles, inspirational videos, ted talks are the same. The only thing they have in common is language. You will find yourself asking yourself question like, how will i utilize this information? How will you filter out all this information? Too much of anything is bad for you, including information, but if you utilize a mental model you are at peace with your mind. The third thing you will realize is that the female brain is not that complex as you think. Women/girls are simple same applies to men/boys. NLP is a powerful tool psychotherapists use to capitalize on your weak brain and it can even be used to manipulate people. That is how powerful it is. If you watch these videos and analyze it at an NLP level 3 you will be amazed. First Link , Second Link, Third Link, Fourth Link. Put the pieces together. The fourth thing you will realize is that you will have a deeper appreciation of stand up comedy. NLP gives you insight into how these comedians think when they tell true stories and simply the use of language. Comedy is by the best use of language and its simply undescribable. Of course you could find the scientific reasons as to why and what makes jokes/comedy funny. From a linguistic perspective comedy is the art of language just as painting digital or traditional are example of visual art.

Side note: This will make more sense when you learn about Brain waves, EEG and Neurofeedback, but here goes. The brainwaves of someone living in confinement, prison or jail are similar to someone in a school system like College. Therefore, the claim that going to school is similar to being in prison/jail is true. Proven by neuroscience.

Action Item: Every time you talk to yourself, pause and pay attention to your thoughts. Question your thoughts, this is the most effective way to take control of your mind. Identify if you are using cognitive distortions and change them, utilize the choice that works best in the long run. NLP level 1 and 2 are easy to understand and explain, but REBT is not. If you need to understand REBT much better consider taking the Udemy course on REBT by Dr Paul J Cline. Its only an hour and thirty minutes and it will be the best investment you will ever make in your life.

How To Learn The Right Way

Now that you know how the mind works, lets get learning. Learning is the key to creating a great life. Learning is a skill that we are born with, but it gets lost over time as a result of the school system. Going to college or the school system for that matter is simply something people do to learn one thing. Sitting in a cold classroom and bad posture is the best way to learn nothing. Paying attention to the clock instead of a teacher, daydreaming instead of being in the moment or asking yourself, why am i here? That is not learning. The way humans learn is interesting and you will realize that the entire school system is toxic. Do you think anything has changed since college was invented in 1636? If you think it has, watch this. Humans have and always have had 4 ways of learning.

1: Humans learn by making mistakes (failure is feedback)

2: Humans learn through creation,not consumption

3: Humans learn through living

4: Humans learn by learning how to learn (metalearning). This requires the use of a technique, VAKS and awareness of which intelligence is your strong suit.

If you are human, you probably already knew this, right?

The school system is very toxic because the paradigm you once knew gets changed. You are told that mistakes means you are stupid. People who make mistakes dont make it in life. Yet, there is difference between the real world and school, never forget that. No matter how great or poorly you do in school,know that the world doesnt look at grades as symbol of excellence. In some cultures were school is taken seriously this still remains. People who make mistakes and learn from them are the ones who succeed in real life. I am sure this sounds familiar, but its true. You know how the mind works, you know that failure is feedback and that statement is an example of NLP. Anyone you can think of Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Trevor Noah, Dave Chapelle or any other celebity you known had to fail before they could use that as feedback to go on. Failure is feedback, its not the end; It only becomes the end if you do nothing about it and just accept it.

This is were modern schooling fails. You have to sit through long boring classes and somehow piece together what the teacher is saying. Learning through consumption is something that plagues peoples mind from a young age and translates into every other aspect of life. You can watch 100 ted talks videos, but if you do nothing its useless and such is a waste of time. Watching that amount of ted talk videos is comparable to watching a netflix series, watching anime or just watching TV in general. Consumption becomes a form of entertainment, time killer. If you live your life by simply consuming and doing nothing you are no different than those people lying comfortably six feet under the grave. Humans learn through creation this is were note taking comes into play. However, the note taking system people use is outdated as the college itself. People take monochrome notes on lines paper, write verbatim and write in the worst handwriting. In order to create better notes it is essential to learn and utilize a different note taking system. I believe this article gets my point across.

Humans learn through living is a fact that should come as no surprise. Its through living that we are not only forced to use our minds, but also adapt to our environment. When 20+ years of your life are wasted in a system of education you are truly missing out on life. There is more to life than a classroom because the real world things change at a rapid pace. In school the time stops, things slow down and you keep asking yourself, why am i here? That question is a sign that people ignore. That question is a clear indicator that you need to reflect, an ancient ritual that most of the human population does not do.

Metalearning- learning how to learn. How do you learn best? When you find the answer to that question learning becomes a fun task as it once was when you were a child and not a daunting tasking that school makes it be. The first step to figure out how you learn is to experiment. You have probably heard of VAK. V stands for visual (see it). Visual is anything from Youtube videos, mind maps, charts, graphs, posters, notes, color coding, timesline, fact list, powerpoint, pictures and articles. Visual is important because it also highlight how the brain works. This is were the quote “a picture is worth a thousand words comes in” The reason this quote is powerful is because we think in pictures and speak in words. A is for Auditory (hear it). Auditory is anything from conversations, podcasts, audiobooks, oral presentation, songs, group discussions and radio. K is for kinesthetic (do it). Kinestheic is all about learning through doing, moving and touching. Kinesthetic includes note taking, games, doodling, mind maps, trace words with finger and any other hands on activity. With the VAK learning style it is usually best to find out which one of these is your strong suit, but you can use all of them for faster and better effects. Now that you know about the learning styles, VAK, it is best to go about finding a memory technique/ mental model that will help you learn and organize information. My personal favorite is the Mindmap memory technique by Tony Buzan. You would have to read the book Mindmap mastery by Tony Buzan to get the full mental model. It works wonders because it correlates to how the brain works and learns. Finding a memory technique requires research, but lucky for you, you can find a handful of techniques in a book called Unlimited Memory by Kevin Horsley. The most challenging thing when it comes to learning is finding out which intelligence is your strong suit. Humans have multiple intelligences and this is a theory that has been around since 1983 thanks to a man named Howard Gardner. This man is famous for two books Frames of Mind (1983) and Multiple Intelligences (1993). The multiple intelligences onces is a more revised and updates version of the original frames of mind. The multiple intelligences theory is not something that is set in stone because you can train yourself to become good at any of these. However, the reason for the multiple intelligenes has got to do with how effortlessly or naturally that you are able to learn. If someone learns piano way faster than someone its because that person is musically intelligent or as people would say “musically gifted”. I will provide a few examples and people, but ultimately reading the book is the only way to understand the language that forms this proven theory. Here are the types of intelligences:

Spatial- Visualizing the world in 3 dimension.

Intrapersonal- understanding yourself, what you feel and what you want. NLP level 3: REBT.

Linguistic- Finding the right words to express what you mean(word/language smart). This is were motivation speakers, spoken word poets, pastors,comedians, polyglots and etc exist. Example include: Tony Robbins, Prince Ea, Bishop TD Jakes, Trevor Noah, Ikenna, Big Bong, Bill Burr, Dave Chapelle, Kevin Bridges, Andrew Schulz, Ronny Chieng, Daniel Tosh, etc.

Bodily Kinesthetic- coordinating mind with body(body smart). This is were you find great athletes: Muhammad Ali, Michael Phelps, Lamar Jackson, Tiger woods, Mike Tyson, Jet Li, Bruce Lee, Donnie yen, Lebron james, Connor Mcgregor, Lionel Messi, Neymar,Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, Usain Bolt, Simon Biles, Lewis Hamilton, etc

Interpersonal- sensing people feelings and motives (people smart). This is were you will find people who usually have a lot of friends in real life, host a talk show or tv show. People like: Joe Rogan, Matt d avella (groundup show), Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Jimmy Kimmel, Dr Phil, Dr Oz

Exisential- tackiling the questions of why we live and why we dive.

Logical/mathematical- Logic smart. This is were the stereotype of asian being smart comes from, mostly because there parents force them and you know (imprint period). This is were people usually associate with IQ. The measure of intelligence or association is usually linked to a person accomplishment or contributions. Theories and the likes. You can find examples of this on your own.

Musical: Music smart. This is were you find all musician, famous or not , musicains non ethe less. Groups and people like: Epic rap battles of history, Jumpsuit records, on and on records, 20syl, psognar, kid cudi, two steps from hell, vulfpeck, christafari, chronixx, gny, the polish ambassador, etc. If you dont know any of those groups or people its alright because eveyone listens to different music and that just happens to be my jam.

Naturalist- Nature smart, understanding living things and reading nature.

A great example of what exceptional learning can look like can be found in this wonderful video.

Action Item: Find out how you learn best, find a technique and find out which intelligence is your strongsuit. It will take a couple of days, but you will eventually get there. When it comes to the subject of learning there is one podcast to which i turn to. I recommend listening to the Kwik Brain podcast by Jim Kwik. If you dont know how to access a podcast, thats fine. You simply have to install an app on your phone or computer, whichever one you prefer. For mobile i recommend Pocket Casts or you can use Google Podcasts/ something else. For your desktop, thats up to you.

Experience is the Message

This book started out strongly by assigning the word religion with college. I provided clear reasoning as to why i began with that word.Later on, i changed from religion to system. However, system in this context was refering to the entire school system from middle or primary school, high/ secondary school and of course of college or university. Ultimately the entire system is broken, sort of like using an app or operating that hasnt been updated in 20 years. In this case, since 1636. Chapter 2 provided the answer to its on title. The answer is obviously no, but what do people do? No plan, no reflection, no questions asked, its the next logical step right? Everyone goes to college, its always been like that, has it though? Chapter 3 took a sudden turn by bringing up the obvious, to stay alive you need an object called money because money gives you choices (cost of living). Chapter 3 was negative because of the statement i made at the end, “the cycle of death continues when people go to college.” In this statement i wanted to combine two quotes, but failed. First quote ,“ People die at 25 and arent buried until they are 75.” The second quote was, “The richest place in the world is the graveyard because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take that first step, keep with the problem, or determined to carry out their dream.” By the cycle of death, i am referring to the moment the school mentality/cogntive distortions kicks in. Schools kill creativity and imagination this is the first death. To the first quote i would argue that people dont die at 25, they die at the age when they start middle or primary school. In the USA its 11 while other countries its much earlier. Side note: that explains why you will see teens in other countries graduating college earlier and younger compared to the USA (20’s and 30’s) The first death is that of the brain and when the brain dies at such an early age its hard to get it back. Its not impossible, but it takes something tragic to reawaken it. The quote speaks about dying and then being buried. The burial is the second death or final death. The second leans into the second quote about the graveyard being the richest place in the graveyard. People die at an early age and the school system makes sure of that. When people dont unlearn which is the way to break the curse of the school mentality they just ease into the second death. They die with regrets, they never learned how their breain works, they never unlearned an they never left behind the strong legacy that they wanted or lived a life true to their self. They might have left something like maybe a child, but nothing of them that is memorable. The cycle of death was simply trying to convery those 2 quotes into one in metaphorical sense, but clarity was not present so i ended up explaining it in this chapter. The cycle of death continues when we continue to live in denial of our existence. Do you think you will be remembered for watching 20,000 Youtube videos? Do you think people will care if you finished everything on Netflix? Do you think your future self will be happy when you wasted all that time working overtime and living for nothing greater than just a paycheck? Do you think when you die that the number of facebook friends will matter? Do you think people feel your regret when you continue to live life the way they want you to live? All these questions are to ultimately engage you in the process of thinking. Mental models centered around death are the most powerful because whatever you are doing now is not important as you think. Death is the only force/tool that can tuly let you see whats really important in life. Your employer wont care if you die, you will be replaced. Your lover wont care if you die, they will proably just live alone or findsomeone else. College doesnt care if you die, they stole something precious from you time. Anyways, i think i will stick to the quote in its original form and leave it open for interpretation. The cycle of death continues when people go to college. Chapter 4, well the title says it all. You learned how your mind works from a neurolinguistic level not a neuroanatomical,neurophysiological, neurochemical, neurobiologica or any other neuro levels. Chapter 5 was on how to learn. It only made sense to follow up how to learn after explaing how the brain works in the previous chapter. Hopefully you watched that video on what exceptional learning looks like. Finally we are here Chapter 6; Experience is the message. I will keep this chapter short, just as i did with chapter 2.

The resources on how you can gain experience are plenty. I wont go into full details, but i will provide 1 example, the rest is up to you. . You can find more on this and covered in great depth in 2 books. The title, experience is the message, speaks for itself.

Two books and its because of these 2 books that this book was born

Forward Tilt by Isaac Morehouse (2017) and Skip College by Connor Boyack (2019). Those books were published 2 years apart, but i would say this is the follow up. Fuck College by 33 nanoseconds (2020). I combine the material and add in a special element. That special element is the Bilingual theory.

Chef: The decision to become a chef could have come from one these three examples.You grew up with parents that are great cooks and you were naturally drawn to the idea of cooking beyond your home kitchen. You fell in love watching cooking shows,cooking videos and maybe the anime Food Wars/ Shokugeki no Souma (its an inside joke, dont watch it or look it up). You went to multiple restaurants when you were young and had a multicultural food experience which drove you to become a chef. Whatever drove you to become chef, you decide its your calling, you don’t need a reason to do what you love. Like any profession its easier to start and gain experience, if your parents are already in that profession or you have connections that can lead you there. You would work in different restaurant around the area first. The goal is expand your skills, cooking knowledge, work with more ingredients and experience new styles.You can travel to other cities within the same country, but to be exceptional travel to other countries. Learn the language and learn the food; Polyglot chef kinda sounds cool. You dont need a specialized school to cook because cooking is done in a kitchen not a classroom; Just as living is done through living and not in a classroom. With all that knowledge and experience you can do anything. You have connections including famous chefs, met some locals, read cookbooks, cooking knowledge, aware of different styles, aware of the food in the cultural context. You have two options. Do i continue cooking for a living or do i branch out and do more? You could settle working 2o plus years working at a prestigious restaurant and hoping for retirement. Or you could do what modern chefs do, build a brand. Build a business, write books, hire other chefs, start a TV show, start a YouTube channel. As a chef you start simple by cooking food for partiest or doing ahome bakery.If you are truly serious about making it official, not working from home you have 2 options. buy a preexisting building , thats what most people do or rent it. The other option is build a restaurant from scratch, you buy land. Find suppliers or local farms and offer them a deal. Owning a restaurant just happens to be an easy thing. No matter what country you go to you can definitely expect a chinese restaurant (that is purely observational and not racist). Its not rocker science the people and resources are there.

Action Item: Think of ways you can gain experience or research people who have done it without a college degree. There is plenty of informations, but if you cant find the answers after researching, please read those 2 Books and try again, the answer is there, its not hidden. For this exercise consider finding ways to gain experience for these professions

Bonus Chapter

You made it this far, congratulate yourself. Most people never read a book all the way, but you are truly exceptional. Lets recap the action items first

Action Items quick recap.

Chapter 1: Unlearn

Chapter 2: NLP exercise: 2 drop outs and 2 opt outs. Complete this exercise on yourself.

Chapter 3: How much does it cost to stay alive? What steps can you take to go beyond just making money to stay alive?

Chapter 4: Pay attention to your thoughts. Utilize all 3 NLP levels: identify cognitive distortions, use mental models and always use REBT to figure out why you feel the way you feel, why you think the you think,why you do the things you do and how to get the most out of life.

Chapter 5: Figure out howyou learn best and also try to figure out how you learn the fastest.

Chapter 6: Figure out how you can gain experience.

Chapter 7 gives you answers to some lifes most difficult questions. These were questions i was asking myself right after i finished highschool. I found the answers to these questions and they are very comprehensive. I have the books that i used to find these answers listed below.

Is College the Only Way?

This has already been covered in Chapter 2, but if you want to find the answer in more detail, you have 2 places to go (books). Skip College by Conor Boyack and Forward Tilt by Isaac Morehouse.

Why do people struggle with money?

This question should come as no surprise because its never taught in school. I know thats not a valid reason, but its a statement that you will hear quite often. People have so much faith in school sort of like a religion, that they tend to believe that school/college will teach them everything there is to know about life. Classrooms and the real world are different, i feel the need to point this out. College only teaches what the government wants you to know and the goal of college is so that you can become an employee. People get offended when you talk about money or try to show them something related to money. Yet, its funny that the same people who are offended have maxed out credits, buy stuff to be happy and admire rich people. When it comes to this particular question, there are three books that answer the question. Three books by the same author and in a specific order. The books are Rich Dad Poor Dad, Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant and Fake. The name of the author goes by the name Robert Kiyosaki. The book, Fake, a book released in 2019 really ties this message altogether. I absolutelt recommend reading all 3 book, but if you want to rush straight to the answer, Fake is must read. In fact, the full title of the book is Fake: Fake Teachers, Fake Money and Fake Assets. The book attacks those three topics vigorously. Sadly enough, the book is only available in paperback at the current time of writing and has not been adapted into an ebook format. You will find the answers there, but if you want to expand your financial IQ you have read some more. 2 more books, Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman and the Nomad Capitalist by Andre Henderson.

How can i learn faster?

Learning is a superpower that can break any physical and psychological boundaries. Polyglots are people who can utilize mutliple languages to break the barriers that exists within people and regions.Programmers are people who can utilize multiple languges to produce amazing applications, cross-platform or platform specific. However, learning is a superpower that is fading because its lost and killed by the school system. The reason children learn fast is because they immerse their senses, use their playful imagination and dont have the word failure imprinted in their minds. The only statements a child knows are try again and surely enough it going to works out. With the school system we are stripped of our immersive experiences, imagination and failure is a word that is introduced into our equation. When the word failure is introduced into our mind, thus begins the birth of cognitive distortions that reign over our lives (NLP level 1). Throughout my research so far i have only found three answers to this question. The answer is divided into 3 techniques:

The first technique is to learn the same way a child does (immersion). Children have something called curiosity and interest, thats what makes them explore. Children will utilize almost all their senses. What does it taste like? Proceeds to… What does it feel like? Proceeds to... What does it smell like? Proceeds to... You can probably guess what happens at the... Children have this unwavering curiosity and interest of things around them. Give a child the internet and you spoil him/her. Have a child meet different, eat different food, expose them to other languges, expose them to different sports, expose them to different musical instrumental, simply have them experience multiple things and they will grow up believing they can do anything. The video of the polyglot dad in chapter 5 gives you a clue. It should come as no surprise that the state of curiosity or this passionate emotion multiplied by something creates a long lasting memory. If their is no interest, no curiosity or no emotion multiply that by anything and you get nothing. Now you know why people who got to college or any schooling systeam dont remember anything they were ever taught. Its something you were able to do long time ago when you were child, but it goes away. You can still learn like a child and it works, like everything in life it will take time.

The second technique is to use a memory technique to try learning something. There are a numbers of memory techniques out there, but the one i absolutely recommend is mind mapping. I wont go about explaining mind mapping in this book because its already been written about. There is a famous book by a man called Tony Buzan and his book is called Mind map mastery. At the end of reading that book you will have learned the most powerful learning tool in the universe invented by humans of course. If you do read the book, but dont like the technique, have no fear because there is another book that will give you more memory techniques to help you learn faster. The techniques covered in the book are useful and effective. The name of the book is called Unlimited Memory by Kevin Horsley. In addition to Mind map mastery and Unlimited Memory there is a third book that i highly recommend. This book is quite self explanatory from the title and its backed by Neuroscience. The name of the bok is called The First 20 Hours: How To Learn Anything Fast. It takes 20 hours to learn any skill you could ever imagine, but there is a technique to it. The book has that answer.

The third technique works if used in conjuction will all these techniques. This technique is a bit more complex. I am not a licensed healthcare proffesional, do your research and talk to your doctor, before proceeding with this technique. This next technique is found in the field of Neuroscience and it goes by the acroynm TDCS. TDCS stands for Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation. TDCS in the simplest explanation is a process by which you place electrodes on your scalp and send small electrical currents to your bain. This process is usually 20 minutes long with its effects lasting for more than an hour. By effect i mean the state of your mind and this particular state of your mind is caled neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is a state of the mind associated with better memory, learning faster, strong neuro connections and overall a heightened sense of perception and awareness. In this state of mind you can learn anything in half the time. Think of skills like playing piano, building muscle memory for sports, learning a language, playing games or anything you could ever imagine. you and doing it repeatedly everyday you can learn anything in the half the time or even better. This is real, its not some conspiracy theory or marketing scheme. Its something that has existed since 3000 BC and here is a link. The advancements that have happened in medicine ever since the early days are amazing and this is just one revelation out of those. The research is tangible and you can read the complicated medical journals published by real doctors, if you still have doubts about it. With TDCS combined with multimodal learning (using a variety of techniques you can learn faster and builder stronger neural connections in your Brain). Below the action item of this chapter, i have provided some links and videos related to TDCS and other brain related/neuroscience topics.

How can i optimize my mental health?

Its no surprise that our brain makes us who we are. I have pointed out this very clearly in chapter 4, when i introduced what i call the bilingual theory. Working on your mental health has this domino effect that also improves your physical health. A great scenario would be this.. Imagine an overweight person and a slim person with high metabolism. If these two people, lets say fainted and somehow had theirs brain switched. The fat person would continue doing the same thing like overeating and all these unhealthy habits. Of course he wouldnt get fat because his new body is equipped with high metabolism, but at a certain age that person will lose that metabolism and weight gain will be effortless. On the other the former slim body brain individual, he will realize that he needs to cut down on certain foods and exercise. over time the results will pay off, but he knows that he has to cautiously watch what he puts into his body and his habits. Weird story, but at the core of it is the brain that makes us. Assuming the brain exchange never happened, but the overweight person was warned not just by health proffesionals, but a physical sign like a violent heart attack, things would change. He would make changes to his life because he realizes that food is necessary for survival, but its not something you should prioritize over your life. You shouldnt wait until you are given two signals in order to start taking care of your Brain. Luckily enough, there is a great doctor on this subject of mental health. The name of this doctor goes by the name Daniel Amen. I believe his book, Memory Rescue, goes above and beyond answering this question.

Is the place i am living suitable for me?

You don’t know unless you travel. The science behind traveling is very complicated and thats why most people dont travel, especially Americans. Travelling requires the exchange of currency to acquire this thing called a plane ticket. Its very complicated because you can book a hotel in advance, save enough for transportation and have money left over for souvenirs. If you ever find yourself asking yourself this question, that is a good thing. Planet Earth has 195 countries in total and if you move away from where you live that is minus one (194). If you dont like doing business or have complaints about your country just move. Move to a different country that speaks the same language or better, move to country that doesnt speak the same language which forces you to learn. You are not stuck in the country you were born in, travel! You are only stuck in the country you were born in, if you were born in North Korea. Most people in North Korea escape because they have a choice to live miserablyand complain or escape and live a better life. On the subject of travel i find YouTube videos more insightful than books. With YouTube you get perspectives from different cultural groups. This is by no means racist: If you are black and wanting to travel, its best to watch multiple videos of black people who have traveled to that country. Travel is a positive experience if you are of a certain skin tone (factually speaking).

Action Item: 1: I need you to leave me a review because it helps improve the content of this book and popularity.

2. Please share this book with any friends and family. It goes along way to spread the message and reach out to more people who are about to make the most important decision of their college. To go to college or not to go.

3. Watch all the videos, browse through the websites and read all the books. One day at a time and you will have a wonderful year. What excuses do you have for not becoming better? Don’t wait until something tragic happens in order to change, do it now. This entire book and its all resources are useless if you dont utilize and apply them to your life. If you don’t utilize the information and resources in this book to your life, you are no different than someone who is illiterate or dead. I know that sounds negative, but its true. Ignore this message and you will learn life the hard way, if thats what you want, i am not stopping you, its your life, use it how you seee fit.
