Dedicated to all Malawians. This book is intended for a bilingual audience with an understanding in English and Chichewa. Please don’t use Google translate and/read, if you don’t understand both.

Malawi, the warm heart of Africa. A country with the most beautiful lake in the world , with over 500 species of fish. The most peaceful country in Africa. One of the top 5 poorest countries in Africa. Living in Malawi is so bad, that its bad for your physical and mental health. Unlike North Korea its easy for us to escape, but even if we do, as long as we carry the residues of the Malawian mentality we can never be free.

As for the title, i went through multiple revision. Previous titles include:

Immigrants Are The Solution; Tale Of A New Malawi

Mabvuto; This is Malawi

Gods Abomination; The Country of Malawi

The titles above sound nice, but i wanted something more trendy. I wanted something that was not too strong and not too weak. I wanted a title that sounded edgy and cool. A title using a word or words from the modern day Chichewa. I heard a song by a wonderful talented musician by the name Patience Namadingo. The song was entitled Madando. The song was amazing from the visuals, the sound and just the fact that it was based on what a politician said. Immediately following the title just clicked and came to me,Madando. As for the subtitle i wanted something representative of our culture. Proverbs….

Dziko

Madando 1:Malawi Sadzatheka

Malawi is the called the warm heart of Africa, but when i observe the surroundings, that phrase raises doubt. Malawi is work in progress….

I would rather be safe and flourish, than safe and hopeless. The warm heart of Africa is poorly named, I disdain….

Ambuye

Madando 2: Ambuye Sanatisiye

I wont study, but i will pray to pass my exams. The religion of Christianity was forced upon us, but it dispelled some of the so called traditions we had. Today, Christianity is the number one religion in Malawi and its use cases are strong. Christianity in Malawi is used to judge others, to steal money, to commit deadly sins, to reason instead of utilizing our Brains, all in the name of lord. We cannot use our Brains or resources because God has a plan for us. God has a plan for you and God has a plan for me. We shall call upon his sons name to help us pass exams without studying, get a promotion without simply asking, to help us in situations that we can solve ourselves,if we tried. If life is not going well the lord is simply testing you, a challenge, he has other plans. The lord is good and will always be good forever. Even if i become homeless God has plans for me. I am Gods vessel, he has not abandoned me. He will restore me. I don’t have to do anything on my part or use my Brain. God will take care of it. God will breath in his wonderful spirit into me and i will move. His spirit is everlasting. But does God really care about Malawi? Think about it. Maybe God only cares about the rich nations like America. God does not recognize the continent of Africa or Malawi for that matter. Maybe God has abandoned us. Does his son Jesus really work? Or is Jesus simply an inferior product? Sometime it works and sometimes it doesn’t. Some people have him and some people don’t. Pastors will sell the power of Jesus in a bottle. That bottle is called Holy water. Holy seems like a good word and it will definitely sell. Pastors are able to drive fancy cars because God blessed them. The money they use to buy that car and upgrade their living was bestowed by God. It simply came from above and was falling like rain. If God was the only thing required to turn everything around then no nation would struggle. After all why would God favor others and not Malawi? Maybe God only works if you speak english. English is the language of prayer. The language used to speak to God. God only answers prayers in English,. What is Tumbuka? What is Chichewa or Nyanga? What is lomwe? What is Chiyao? What is Chipwitikizi? If God really works why is Malawi still struggling? Does God only work for those who cant help themselves? Or does he help in addition to people who are able to help themselves? Jesus is the way the truth and the life. Is he really though? Have you seen the roads in Malawi? Have you seen that many trees lately?Have you gone outside?

I am not into politics nor am i interested about government. For this section i had to consult with people who follow Malawian politics and even have a chat with politicians. We can honestly blame all our problems on the government because ….

Mabodza

Madando 18: Kukhulupilira mabodza

Malawians don’t believe in God, they believe in lies and conspiracy theories. Humans are susceptible in believing all sorts of things. When you hear something 3 times you are more likely to believe it. In Malawi you just need to hear it once and you will somehow automatically believe it. People don’t have ways of fact checking and our news coverage is not that great. A group of people can simply make up lies and spread them….

Madando 19: Umphawi sungandiletse kukhala ndi ana

This is another shocking revelation. People are still having kids. More kids will be born and come to the realization that Malawi is not dream friendly. If you have big dreams then by all means travel or flee to another country. Malawi does not posses the equipment, funds to help you achieve your dreams. When you grow up in Malawi you come to the realization that dreams are just dreams. You have them, but you cant do anything about them. People have children for 2 reasons. To leave a legacy and have someone take care of them when they are older. In Malawi it simply does not make sense to have kids. They wont take care of you when you get a older and they will live a regretful life. In other words when people have kids they are simply adding more problems and leaving regrets not legacies. If you cant take care of yourself, you shouldn’t have kids, but that is not something that crosses peoples minds. China realized that there country has a problem. Overpopulation. Its through that problems they invented some of the most complex systems of transportation. Put more people into work instead of robots. Malawi has many problems and having kids wont solve the problems it only adds more fuel. If People in Maalwi stopped having kids, solving problems would be much faster…

This is the last chapter, but please bear with me. This chapter is bound to make you enraged and filled with fear. I am finally come off as rude or show my true colors. You might be thinking in your head, what would you know? You are living in America you dont know anything about struggle. I lived in Malawi for 13 years and i can assure you i know the struggle. I left when i was 13 in 2013 and came to America. I didnt revisit my country until i was 20 in 2020. I stayed there for a month. My senses were reawakened and reality dawned upon me. Everything is much worse than i left. I gathered the courage to talk to many people. I gathered as much material to enrich this book. I am simply articulating what i have learned, my experience and other peoples experiences. As previously mentioned i provided multiple solutions, but this chapter has the ultimate solution. I call it the ultimate solution because it will work. It will work because its not insane. Just a reminder, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting something different. If you keep eating fast food, whats the point of trying to lose weight?

The current Malawi seems hopeless and quite frankly it is. Even if you are positive everyone else will bring you down. The poverty has affected their minds. Your own family could send someone to rob you. The new Malawi is coming soon and its dangerous to say the least. Malawians will be faced with 2 options. Either they flee their own country or fight for the place they once called home. You might be thinking that thats exxagerated, but its not. All those Malawians who escaped overseas dont truly care. They are living a better life elsewhere and most will retire anywhere,but Malawi. They will spare some spare change or donated things they dont use. They think that by sending a few things will make great change happen. How would summarize Malawi into one? What our number one problem. The answer may shock you and the answer may infuriate you. I will explain the answer in much more detailed reasoning. Education. That word has a nice tune associated with it and horror attached to it. We are still using an outdated school system or a useless school system. The fact that people cant read and write their own language is simply a shame. The fact that our English sucks. If we change our school system throughout the entire country do you think Malawi will be the same. If we introduce more languages instead of just English and Chichewa. With a redesigned school system, what purpose does witchcraft serve? Witchcraft is imply a vice for the uneducated. Magic or voodoo will not replace practice.

If we succeed you wont even need to imagine because the new malawi will look like this.

Malawi was once of the poorest countries in Africa, but the tides have changed. We are much better than South Africa, Nigeria and Rwanda. We are a role model for other African countries. You wouldn’t believe that if told you yesterday/in the past. Malawi was once called the warm heart of Africa, but that name has changed. Malawi is the Japan of Africa. As weird or funny as that maybe, if you want to get a taste of the future Japan is no longer the only place. Our country runs 100% on renewable energy. Solars panels are installed on the roof of each house, windmills are everywhere and we are able to utilize high end hydroelectric energy. If you bought a Tesla and imported it to Malawi people would have called you crazy. Electric cars are everywhere and they solved the long wait lines just to get fuel. Our money was the only currency that never made it big into a digital form. You can use Kwacha with paypal or other services online. Kwacha is weak, but thankfully cryptocurrency is strong. Malawi fully adopted cryptocurrency and now it was a norm. We used to fear foreigners, but not anymore. They brough us opportunites and provided acces to their countries for opportunies more. Some people still practice witchcraft, but its honestly useless. Education is the key not magic or witchcraft. Malawians are exposed to more language and you can learn those languages. You can learn chinese, french,japanese and not just english. People no longer go to the west becuase you find better opportunities in the east.

I write books that i would want to read and this is the result of that. The titles and artworks i created are a reflection of that. These books have helped me and i am certain that they will add value to you as well.

Fuck College

￼

College has and continues to kill more people than any virus or disease known to humanity. College is not the only way and the truth is you have options. This book combines information from every book that came before and adds a special element called Neuroscience.

Offensive Numbers

￼

This book is experimental. The idea behind it fictitious, but its message is non fiction. Self help books are told from a human perspective. What if, an alien told the story of humans by transforming into one and reverting to his/her original form?

Poetic Memes

￼

A poetry anthology of original poems based on current events, memes and thoughtful creativity.

XDA University
