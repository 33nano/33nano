### America

Dear America,

You cannot control the world, so please stop trying. Stop trying to brainwash the world with your western values, its inhumane. Your army does not bring peace, it instills fear. What is wrong with you? Why can't you adopt the metric system, your imperial system sucks. Your ideology of individualism has gone too far. People need Ubuntu. A plutonomy composed of corporate greed and slave contracts. Your individualism is what led to the massive spread and high numbers of covid-19 infections and death. A government composed of lies, a president who is a puppet of the rich and only a representative to make people believe they have power. 

America:
1. a plutonomy 
2. Your individualism is too extreme
3. You can't control the world (you can't fool Russia and China)
4. You are on the brink of collapse and I hope you do. Eurasia and Africa are the only places of significance
5. You poison the world with your media of self promoting narcissism, consumerism
6. Your education is overpriced, outdated and trains people to become high tax paying employees. Brainwashing factory
7. Capitalism is your main religion , surveillance capitalism, 
8. Your propaganda is meant to lock your citizens from traveling outside and seeing the truth. Africa is a continent not a country you fucking idiot. No you piece of shit, its not animals, huts and aids everywhere
9. Militarization of police(brutality), racial profiling,

### Porn Addict

Dear Porn Addict



Its not your fault that your eyes were violated and forced to see the pleasurable evils of this world. We are born, not pure, but blank like the slate of tabularasa. We are slowly corrupted by our surroundings and rapidly radicalized by the intangible strings of the internet. Your relationships are suffering, your mind is amok. The feeling devours you. Not even hunger and willpower can revert you. You are a porn addict. A person who  escapes reality in search of sexual pleasure. A pleasure that intensifies after the first. A pleasure that slowly deteriorates the memory. A pleasure riddled with a peak of tumultuous shame. The void of loneliness, the complex of acne and deteriorater of hair growth (grey). How much longer shall you continue to commit adultery ? How much longer will let your mind be filled by the tropes of toxic masculinity? Why have you abandoned your dreams and settled for less? Do you believe you can form intimacy with human beings of the opposite sex? If you're unable to reflect on these questions, its time you seeked helped. You can no longer listen to the little homunculus in your head telling you that _you can quit anytime you please,_ but in reality you can not. 

Let go of the shameful past

And become a new creation. I fear for what the camera has done to humanity. I even fear for my offspring, though i have not yet procreated and they have not been conceived. Is an adult blocking DNS enough to block and filter out the sex-craved culture that the world has become. The music, videos and even the books are corrupt. How can one possibly turn away from the sexual desires of this world, except become a monk? Celibacy and sexual transmutation seem like ancient words when confronted with the eye candy that is prevalent everywhere. Curves, big booty, anal, blow job, the list of things that a man must have access to, otherwise labeled lame.

### Prince

<span style='color:#7485ff;'>Dear **Prince**</span>

Congratulations on your outstanding achievements. Your mind is finally liberated. I have seen you grow with own two eyes and I am amazed at what you have become. <span style='color:#ffc58b;'>_Gratitude_</span> made you realize that you are already a complete being. A <span style='color:#ffc58b;'>_Second Brain_</span> made you realize that knowledge isn't something you hoard, but distill and share. <span style='color:#ffc58b;'>_Minimalism_</span> made you realize that less is more: more time, more focus and more energy. You have amassed multiple mental models, you have created a decentralized identity, become a polyglot and become one with humanity (Ubuntu).
