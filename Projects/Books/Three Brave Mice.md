# Chirunga Kingdom

Once upon a time, there was a kingdom in the land of flames called Chirunga. Chirunga was a very beautiful place. It had plenty of sunshine , hills everywhere and was home to all kinds of animals. The animals were just as smart as the people that lived there.

  
  

# Bwila, Singa, Dzera

In Chirunga there lived three brave mice. Their names were Nile, Singe and Dzera. All of the mice were popular to the point that they lived with the king of Chirunga in his palace.

  
  

# King Bingiza

King Bingiza was the ruler of the kingdom of Chirunga. He was well known for being humble and kind. King Bingiza was also a farmer. He had plenty of farms across the land of Chirunga. The king was so generous that not a single animal or human went hungry.

  
  

# The Farm Animals

King Bingiza’s farm also had lots of animals. He treated all the animals fairly, but gave special treatment to the three brave mice. The other animals were jealous of the mice. The three brave mice talked behind the kings back and even stole food from the kings food storage.

  
  

# The Incurable Disease

One day, all the animals were gathered in a meeting at the kings palace. Fwipi, the kings personal guard was in charge of leading the meating. Fwipi had heard rumors of a disease that was infecting animals in the northern kingdom. Nganga, one of the kings servants also confirmed of the spreading rumors. Nganga spoke and said, ‘the kings of Tuna and Eguputo believe that the cure to this disease is killing all the mice. The three brave mice were scared and didn’t know what to do.

  
  

# Get rid of the Mice

“What do we need to do?” asked the king. “We fear for the lives of the people and animals of our great kingdom, great king,” replied Fwipi, “and more importantly. we fear for your dear life,” Fwipi bragged “Yes.- the king responded “I have been hearing squeaking noise of Mice in my palace; something needs to be done quickly.” The king spoke emphatically realizing the seriousness of the subject. “We have to get rid of all the mice in the kingdom and you must start with my palace,” the king ordered. “The council has already decided on a good plan.” Mganga assured the king. “Tomorrow one of us will plant something in the palace to get rid of the mice race”

  
  

# Hearsay and ill intention

Tulo, the kings brother did not agree with the plans that Fwipi and Nganga suggested. Tulo believed that the rumors were just there to scare the king. Tulo decided he would look for a solution himself. As the successor of the throne, he wanted to prove that he was better than his brother, Bingiza.

  
  

# Tread Carefully

Nganga and Fwipi argued with the kings brther Tulo. They believed that he was out of his mind.

  
  

# This is a crisis

The following morning, the three mice were going to fetch breakfast in the kings storage for their friends in the field, but something mysterious happened. There was a metal object which appeared to look like an open jaw of lion’s mouth. It was a trap set up to capture the three brave mice, but luckily they spotted in just in time.

  
  

# This Mice Meeting

The next day the three brave mice gathered in a garden. Singe and Lunga had also gathered in the garden. Singa told the mice that something evil had been planted in the palace. Lunga

  
  

# Let us remove the trap

But this is serious guys.” cried Bwila. “Man is alleging that our brothers and sisters in the northern kingdoms are infecting people and animals with a lethal disease,” enlightened Bwila. “So what they are trying to do is to get rid of all of us before we infect them.” concluded Bails. There was dead silence in the meeting. “But that is a blue lie,” Mwiyo. the oldest of them all broke the silence “We do not suffer from the same diseases humans do,” chimed another old mouse called Gast, using the opportunity to educate others. “Point of order!Let no not waste our energy on the conspiracy, rather let us find the way of getting rid of the existing problem.” Shouted lucre “Where is the trap?” asked Mwiyo. “We already said it is right in the palace” Bwila replied. There was silence at the mention of the word of ‘Palace.’

  
  

# We would rather die

What is it?” asked Singa. “You know we have never set our feet in the sacred house, the sight of King Bingisa petrifies us” reminded Mwiyo. “And even if we go inside the palace, who among us can he determined enough to come closer to something that looks like a mouth of a lion?” charged Lungs cowardly. “But this is a matter of life and death: and how are you guys going to survive without food supplies.” Retorted Singe. “We would rather die of hunger outside the palace that endangering our lives inside there,” Charged Kwiyo.

  
  

# Remember the Calamity

“And remember the mishap which befell the great exiled mouse poet Mpanje who was almost killed when he dared to come closer to a similar trap,” warned Mwiyo “Guys, let us not frighten each other with by the atrocities our fellow mice endured during the reign of Mkango the great.” Charged Bwila. There was a brief silence as the brave three pondered over the issue. “Then what do you suggest?” queried Singe. “What about asking for help from the bigger animals on the farm, after all these guys have been benefiting from the news which we have been bringing to them from the palace,” suggested Bwila “Good suggestion,” echoed Dmera. “Unlike us, these animals are big enough to deal with the trap,” reasoned Nem. “I will go and see Mrs Chicken, Bwila speak to Mr Goat and ‘here will plead with Mrs Cow.” delegated Singe.

  
  

# Mrs Chicken our jobs is to lay eggs

Right away Bwila ran to the chicken house Panting for breath she arrived at the door step. Good day dear chickes gretted Bwila.what brings you here? asked mother chicken. there is an impending danger to our lives. repied bwila . what is the danger. asked mother chicken irritably. We need to get help to remove the trap in the palace. begged Bwila. Nonsense. charged mother chicken. What has the trap to do with us? Our job on this farm is to lay eggs for the king. full stop. we do not go inside the kings palace. do we? Bwila begged. almost crying. Please Please Mother chicken? I said no. charged mother chicken.

  
  

# Mr Goat, I am busy

“Good day Mr Goat, how are you?” asked Singa. “Fine and you. what Palace news do you have today? Mr Goat responded , “I have bad news and i need your help.” responded Singa “What do you need?” asked Mr Goat. “There is a trap in the palace which is dangerous to us and we need your help to remove it” responded Singa. “Sorry Singe, at the moment. I as busy with family issues: my wife has just given birth. and I would rather attend to pertinent issues,” Mr Goat excused himself.” Maybe try Mrs Cow, she has hooves like an iron. she can crash the trap for you.” suggested Mr Goat.

  
  

# Mrs Cow, Maybe next time

good aftenoon mrs cow asked dzera. what brings you to our kraal. at midday. asked mrs cow. madam we are in deep problems. there is a trap in the palace. retorted dzera. so quizzed mrs cow. would you please assist us in removing it. responded dzela. the issue of the trap has got nothing to do with us. our job on the farm is to provide milk for the king. responded mrs cow. sorry mister. maybe next time. mrs cow responded rather disinterestingly. but madam remember the old saying we live together. we die together. advised dzela.

  
  

# I think it’s a snake

The brave three begged and begged but no animal came to their rescue. “Guys all the animals are declining to help us remove the trap?” the brave three brain stormed. “Let us go and explore if it is possible to remove it ourselves,” Proposed Bwila, the bravest of the three. “Hey guys, watch out!” Shouted Singa. ” Something has been captured on the trap,” screamed Bwila. “Let’ s draw closer to see what it is,” suggested !helm. “Wow! I think it is a snake,” suggested Bella. “Yes, it is a Black Mamba!” exclaimed Singe.

  
  

# I have been bitten

watch out. the king is walking towards the trap warned bwila. oh my goodness. he cannot see the trapped snake, observed bwila. let us warn the king. suggested singa. but how. asked dzela. help somebody help me. cried king bingiza in agony. i have been bitten by a snake. the kings caretakers quickly carried him to the sick room. immediately call for a doctor. the king shouted.

  
  

# It is poisonous Indeed

Doctor Mamba entered. the king’s sick room. “Let me first see the snake.” requested the doctor. “There it is.” pointed Fwipi to a three meter dead black mamba. “It is a very poisonous snake indeed,” Stated Masamba. “Treatment will take over two weeks”

  
  

# Slaughter all the Chickens

is that so. responded fwipi however i have a special request to make the doctor muttered. what is it doctor. asked fwipi. can you please prepare some food for my entourage for the week we will be attending the king. request masamba. no problem responded fwipi. nganga can you please come closer, i need to discuss something with you. shouted fwipi how many chickens do we have in the pen asked fwipi. we have fifty five sir. responded nganga. we have to slaughter all the chickens to feed the doctors entourage. ordered fwipi. All the chickens on the farm were slaughtered.

  
  

# Forty goats were slaughtered

The condition of king Bingisa got worse. Many people from neighboring kingdoms flocked to Chirunga to see the sick king. The men and women responsible for preparing food for the guest presented a problem to Fwipi. “Sir we have run out of food to save the guest. what should we do?” “Hold on, let me first find out.” responded Fwipi. Once again he called for Nganga. “Nganga do we have some chickens in the pen?” Fwipi queried. “Sir remember you told us to slaughter all the chicken,” Replied Nganga. “Okay, how many goats do we have in the kraal?” Fwipi enquired. “We have sixty sir.” replied Nganga. “Please slaughter all the sixty.” ordered Fwipi. “We are overwhelmed with guests,” The sixty goats were slaughtered.

  
  

# The root cause of the problem

the kings condition grew worse to the point that he could no longer speak. Doctor masamba summoned the chiefs council in private. ladies and gentlemen i have tried all i could. i have administed the strongest drug possible to no avail. narrated the doctor defeatedly. however, one last thing. we have to do is to find the root cause of the illness and get rid of it. maybe we can save the king. the doctor paused. If i may ask you gentlemen who planted the trap in the kings palace the members of the kings council looked at each other without saying a word. the ancestral spirits say the person who brought this spell into the palace will have to be banisheed from the kingdom. he will be required to take with him the trap he bough this is the only way we can save the ailing king. commanded doctor masamaba who planted the trap in the palace. masamba repeated the questions. again there was silence okay then we have to try and ask the sick king himself. maybe he can hear our words and speak out.

  
  

# Pointed towards one man

The doctor and the chief’s council entered the king’s sickroom. “Your majesty. if you are able to hear us.” Doctor Masamba spoke in a low tone. “The spirits are asking, who among us brought this spell into the kingdom?” There was silence in the room. Suddenly the king opened his eyes slightly. He raised his arm weakly and pointed the frail fore finger to the trap. Then he slowly directed the arm towards the chief’s council. The frail fore finger pin pointed one man; Fwipi. Then it slowly came down to a rest. As the arm was coming to the rest, so was King Hingisa joining his ancestors.

  
  

# The cows slaughtered

many people came from far and wide to attend the funeral. these included kings from neigboring kindgoms. the kingdom was overwhelmed by the attendants. the chief council agreed to slaughter all the cows to meet the overwhelming demand for food.

  
  

# Banished

As the cows were being slaughtered. Fwipi and his family were being driven out of the kingdom. It was clear that he was responsible for the had spirit in the kingdom. On instruction from Doctor Masamba. Fwipi was forced to take with him the trap and the dead snake.

  
  

# Crowned Heroes

as fwipi and his family was being banished from the kingdom. another family was entering the glory of victory. although they were frail and almost dying pf hunger. their hearts were filled with a sense of victory. the fact that the mice family has not eated since the trap was discovered in the palace. did not stop them from dancing using the little energy left in their bodies. they breathed the fresh air of freedom. for the first ime they set their feet on the sacred palace as they sang a new song of liberation. they were on their way to present honorary degrees of hersoism to the three brave mice who pursuded the path of freedom o matter what they sung zomwa anachita bwila anabewula fwipi beu beu beula fwipi zomwa a singa anachita anabewula fwipi. zomwe dzera anachita anabewula fwipi. the stuggle continues…
