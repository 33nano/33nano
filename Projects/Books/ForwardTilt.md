<details> <summary>2 Biggest Secrets to Success</summary>
<span style="color:red">
1) What you can do thats of value to others
2) How well you can signal that value
You need the product and the signal. Better yet, be the product and the signal.
I possess a variety of skills , but i have not achieved mastery. I am aware that it takes time to improve anything and that a mans efforts are never betrayed. However, the second part is what truly poses a challenge for me. Having superb talent, but without having the means to signal it, grow an audience or even discovered. That is something that i have come to learn the hard way, especially with the global pandemic of 2020. I could be a superb writer, but if not many people discover you, you struggle.  I have learned this by publishing ebooks on Google Play Books, Kobo and Amazon Kindle Store (Kindle direct publishing). I have also encountered this lesson by trying to write articles, blogs and poetry on various platforms. The centralized web will take more time for sure, but the decentralized web really depends on the platform. 
I have come to find out that writing featured posts is probably the best way to go about it and using professional platforms like LinkedIn can also boost my presence.  Mostly recently the opportunity present itself when i was asked if i wanted to write a post on the dapp.com website . Being featured in the doctor dapp series would open up great possibilities. I learned by experimenting and trying different things. I take with me the lessons that shall drive me forward. In terms of publishing, i would have to spend some money on proofreading and have them share to their circles. Social engineering. Collaboration if you will. Thats the writing part
Music is another area that i find interest. Choir had a huge influence on me when a friend introduced me to the course in high school. Another highschool introduced me to Fruity Loop Studio. With music its quite tricky. Soundcloud is a great place to start, but its not the place that  you want to be. With music i have simply experimented, but i havent tried to release my music on streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Google play music. I am aware that i could easily have my music hosted there should i decide to invest a couple of fees. but the real reason i am quite skeptical is due to the fact that i havent really gotten mixing and mastering down. The other is that i am trying to go for lyrical music with actual vocals. I havent tried that yet. Thats a lame excuse, but thats the current situation with that. As far as things go, i am aware that collaboration is the best way to boost my online musical presence. Its a lame excuse, but i will get it down in no time. Thats the msic bit.
ever since i was young, i always wanted to be an animator, but being introduced to YouTube, i was no longer interested. The beauty of youtube lies in the fact that you can find just about any video and have a peek into the behind the scenes of what you want to become, day in the life of insert career. Frame by frame seems like torture and thats because it is. I have a deeper appreciation of 2D animation, but the process is not something i like and its not something that i would like doing for a living. I have tried animating using various software out there and i was certain that its not something that i wanted to do. I have no further interest in learning more. The idea of animation went down the drain entirely, even after learning about modular 2d animation which utilizes bones. 3D did strike me, but the limitation of hardware fell upon me. Its something that i could try to pursue as a side hobby or full blown career in the future. Until then, i put the idea of animation to rest.
I recently found myself trying different things which is something that i absolutely recommend. Similar to how we are able to have free trials of a product or service the same should be applied to life. You get to decide which product works best for you and what to discard. Never say i want to be blank when i grow up unless you try it. I want to be a doctor, but later find out you hate the site of blood. I want to become a 2d animator only to find out you hate drawing stuff frame by frame. However, at this point in time, the global pandemic sped up the discovery process. Game development is something i truly want to pursue. The idea of being able to combine different elements such as animation, art, music, code to produce something interactive is awesome. The gaming industry is huge and i only see a few game developers when it comes to mobile. The concept of game development strikes me because i believe games teach one of the most fundamental lesson to humanity. We learn through failure. Things like simulated games help prepare for the real thing. Games that help you improve your memory. Something even more interesting which  i plan to make my life works is something helps you learn faster, manage your finances and improve your overall brain health. Without the need for having multiple apps. 
Realistically, i want to be a blockchain, game and mobile developer. I would create value by creating stuff for clients, selling ready to use code with UI kits, soundtracks and just about any assets that revolve around this three. The year 2020 has taught me so much about building a presence online. I still have a long wait to go, but with more connections, collaboration, offering tutorials through blog and videos, i certainly on the right path. I am learning to build my own personal brand. I am certain that i will have the skills in near time and that i will certainly grow my audience. The beauty of numbers, documentation and tracking is key. As long as i make each day a non zero day, everything will work out. 
There is no cheat or quick lottery ticket that will make you appear more valuable. Certainly not a college degree will make you more valuable. My coworkers and boss dont exist to make me better. Its all up to me. </span>

<details> <summary>Slow Down</summary>
You are not late
I kinda feel like i need to be constantly reminded of this statement. When i look around, some young dude, younger than me, not even a teenager has just set the course of his entire life by creating something thats amassing tons of money and fame. The rest of us can only envy, and try to compare ourselves to that person, even though we shouldn’t. I am reminded by Dave chapelle in his sticks and stones special when he told the story about a famous television celebrity. This man had the best job in the world, traveling the world and eating food on camera. That same man killed himself. No matter how someones life looks like on the outside, you dont know whats going on inside. He later proceeded to make the jump about catching up with an old high school friend. This man had worked his way out of the streets through sheer intellect, but love drunk in harvard he married to quickly and the divorced robbed this man whole. However, this man was living with his parents and working elsewhere to slowly restore his life. The slow down speech is something that should constantly be repeated unto me because the reality is as long as you are alive and able you can do anything. I have read news of old people switching careers, people finding career in the ages that most people retire. 
I dont care if you’re 16 or 33. You are not ahead or behind because you not on any conveyor belr or timeline. The path you’re following is your own. Become greater one day at a time and the rest will follow.

<details> <summary>Stop Thinking About It</summary>
This chapter truly resonates with me and its probably my biggest weakness.  I am an idealist, which many sound cool, but its not. I am always thinking of ideas for various things like app ideas, cool names, cool titles or cool designs, but the problem is I never do it. If I can successfully make the transition from thinking into action, my life will fall into its rightful place. Another word for this type of thinking is called 
Dreams dont come true, decision do. 
Top 5 regrets of the dying
what do you want to do before your die?

Thinking gets you nowhere. Take the leap and do the thing.
