Chirunga Kingdom

In those old days. when the Earth was still young there was a kingdom in the land of Flames. Its name was Chirunga. Chirunga was known for its beautiful hills and abundant sunshine. It was also popular because of its wise animals. It is rumored that both animals and people had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.

Bwila, Singa, Dzera

In Chirunga there lived three brave mice. Their names were Nile, Singe and Dsera. Unlike the ordinary mice. Bwila, Singe and Dzera were famous among their peers. They were famous because of their unequal bravery. The brave three’ as they were popularly known managed to find a home in the king’s palace. Not that there was anything particularly special about the palace. It housed the most feared person in the land. THE KING.

King Bingiza

King Bingisa was the ruler of the kingdom of Chirunga. He was a strict king who ruled the kingdom with an iron fist. Despite being tough, many people liked him. He was a good farmer. He grew many crops and kept lots of farm animals. King Bingisa ordered that all the people of the kingdom should not grow crops or raise animals of their own but be fed from the king’s farm. Not a single person went hungry in the kingdom.

The Farm Animals

King Bingisa’s farm had lots of animals. Surprisingly all the animals on the farm envied the three mice. The farm animals thought that Bwila, Singe and Dzera were not contributing anything to the farm. They were just enjoying a posh lifestyle in the palace. Feasting on the king’s abundant grain reserves. However among their fellow mice the three were heroes. They were supplying the mice family with food stolen from the king’s granaries. In addition to that they were supplying classified information to the other farm animals of what was happening in the palace.

The Incurable Disease

One day, there was en extraordinary meeting in the palace. As usual Nile, Singe and Dnera listened attentively to the deliberations. King Bingisa was meeting the king’s council. “Your majesty, the great king,” Fwipi, the chief security councilor cleared his throat, there are rumors coming from the Northern kingdoms that Nice are spreading an incurable disease to farm animals and people. “True. I have also heard about it!” concurred Nganga. the chief servant responsible for farm animals. “Rumors are saying that the disease is spreading fast,” He paused to get some breath. “As I am speaking, the Kings of Tuna and Eguputo have ordered all the mice of their kingdoms killed,” The mice stood in disbelief and almost screamed. “Once the animals or the people are infected by the disease,” Fwipi, continued. “they never recover”

Get rid of the Mice

“What do we need to do?” queried the king. “We fear for the lives of the people and animals of our great kingdom, great king,” replied Fwipi, “and more importantly. we fear for your dear life,” Fwipi bragged “Yes.- the king responded “I have been hearing squeaking noise of Nice in my palace; something needs to be done quickly.” The king spoke emphatically realizing the seriousness of the subject. “We have to get rid of all the mice in the kingdom and you must start with my palace,” the king ordered. “The council has already decided on a good plan.” Mganga assured the king. “Tomorrow one of us will plant something in the palace to get rid of the mice race”

Hearsay and ill intention

However Tulo, the kings brother stood to oppose the plan.“Your majesty, with all due respect, as you are aware that you appointed me to protect the rights of these minority animals, I vehemently oppose the plan,” Tulo fumed. These plans are based on hearsay and ill intention. The king interjected “Shut up Tulo! You don’ t know what you are saying, and sit down,” Shouted king Bingisa “What the council is planning is for your own good.” the king paused and then said “Remember you are the heir to the throne.-

Tread Carefully

“But gentlemen, I think Tulo is right.” Nganga opposed slowly and thoughtfully “Remember how the farm animals almost rioted when one little mouse was found dead under mysteriously circumstances. All the animals knew that the little mouse did not commit suicide.” Shut up Ngangal” Charged Bingisa “I don’t like cowards and double minded councilors, and mind you, do not bring the suicide issue here.” Silence engulfed the meeting as the king was evidently fuming. “That is why I have always said Faipi is my most loyal councilor I have ever had” Bingisa paused to grasp for air.” Ne will stick to whatever plans these guys have in mind. case closed.”

This is a crisis

The following morning, the three mice were going to fetch breakfast in the granaries for their colleagues in the fields, as usual. They saw something unusual standing on the freeway. There was a metal object which appeared like an open jaw of lion’s mouth. The three stopped abruptly, “Probably this is what the councilors meant when they stated, “we will plant something in the Palace. Singe muttered. “This is a crisis, we have to immediately get help from our friends in the field,” Singe proposed. “Yes, let’ s start with our own race; we should summon all the mice for a meeting immediately.” Dmela added. “But where?” queried Bwila “remember the mice fear to come anywhere closer the kings palace. “Let’s meet them under the mango tree, in the kings orchard” Bwila proposed.

This Mice Meeting

The following day the mice of the kingdom gathered in the Orchard. They were surprised to see the faces of ‘the brave three’ unusually cast dom. “Something must be terribly wrong,” they thought. The air of uncertainly engulfed the meeting, Singa cleared his throat as he opened the meeting. “Ladies and Gentlemice, I have very bad news for you this morning.” He posed to feel the impact of his opening words “Something that threatens our very existence has been planted by man in our midst,” Singa broke the news. “What is it?” asked Lunga, the spokesmice of the mice living outside the palace. “It is a thing that looks like…… has teeth…. and is yawning right on the path to the palace granaries,” stammered Singa. “That’ s nonsense, What is it that has teeth like a lion except the lion himself?” Lunga questioned poetically.

Let us remove the trap

But this is serious guys.” cried Bwila. “Man is alleging that our brothers and sisters in the northern kingdoms are infecting people and animals with a lethal disease,” enlightened Bwila. “So what they are trying to do is to get rid of all of us before we infect them.” concluded Bails. There was dead silence in the meeting. “But that is a blue lie,” Mwiyo. the oldest of them all broke the silence “We do not suffer from the same diseases humans do,” chimed another old mouse called Gast, using the opportunity to educate others. “Point of order!Let no not waste our energy on the conspiracy, rather let us find the way of getting rid of the existing problem.” Shouted lucre “Where is the trap?” asked Mwiyo. “We already said it is right in the palace” Bwila replied. There was silence at the mention of the word of ‘Palace.’

We would rather die

What is it?” asked Singa. “You know we have never set our feet in the sacred house, the sight of King Bingisa petrifies us” reminded Mwiyo. “And even if we go inside the palace, who among us can he determined enough to come closer to something that looks like a mouth of a lion?” charged Lungs cowardly. “But this is a matter of life and death: and how are you guys going to survive without food supplies.” Retorted Singe. “We would rather die of hunger outside the palace that endangering our lives inside there,” Charged Kwiyo.

Remember the Calamity

“And remember the mishap which befell the great exiled mouse poet Mpanje who was almost killed when he dared to come closer to a similar trap,” warned Mwiyo “Guys, let us not frighten each other with by the atrocities our fellow mice endured during the reign of Mkango the great.” Charged Bwila. There was a brief silence as the brave three pondered over the issue. “Then what do you suggest?” queried Singe. “What about asking for help from the bigger animals on the farm, after all these guys have been benefiting from the news which we have been bringing to them from the palace,” suggested Bwila “Good suggestion,” echoed Dmera. “Unlike us, these animals are big enough to deal with the trap,” reasoned Nem. “I will go and see Mrs Chicken, Bwila speak to Mr Goat and ‘here will plead with Mrs Cow.” delegated Singe.

Mrs Chicken our jobs is to lay eggs

Right away Bwila ran to the chicken house Panting for breath she arrived at the door step. Good day dear chickes gretted Bwila.what brings you here? asked mother chicken. there is an impending danger to our lives. repied bwila . what is the danger. asked mother chicken irritably. We need to get help to remove the trap in the palace. begged Bwila. Nonsense. charged mother chicken. What has the trap to do with us? Our job on this farm is to lay eggs for the king. full stop. we do not go inside the kings palace. do we? Bwila begged. almost crying. Please Please Mother chicken? I said no. charged mother chicken.

Mr Goat, I am busy

“Good day Mr Goat, how are you?” asked Singe. “Fine and you. what Palace news do you have today? Mr Goat responded inquisitively. “I have bad news which requires your assistance.” responded Sings “What type of assistance?” asked Mr Goat. “There is a trap in the palace which threatens our lives and we would like you to help no remove it,” responded Singe. “Sorry Singe, at the moment. I as busy with family issues: my wife has just given birth. and I would rather attend to pertinent issues,” Mr Goat excused himself.” Maybe try Mrs Cow, she has hooves like an iron. she can crash the trap for you.” suggested Mr Goat.

Mrs Cow, Maybe next time

good aftenoon mrs cow asked dzera. what brings you to our kraal. at midday. asked mrs cow. madam we are in deep problems. there is a trap in the palace. retorted dzera. so quizzed mrs cow. would you please assist us in removing it. responded dzela. the issue of the trap has got nothing to do with us. our job on the farm is to provide milk for the king. responded mrs cow. sorry mister. maybe next time. mrs cow responded rather disinterestingly. but madam remember the old saying we live together. we die together. advised dzela.

I think it’s a snake

The brave three begged and begged but no animal came to their rescue. “Guys all the animals are declining to help us remove the trap?” the brave three brain stormed. “Let us go and explore if it is possible to remove it ourselves,” Proposed Bwila, the bravest of the three. “Hey guys, watch out!” Shouted Singa. ” Something has been captured on the trap,” screamed Bwila. “Let’ s draw closer to see what it is,” suggested !helm. “Wow! I think it is a snake,” suggested Bella. “Yes, it is a Black Mamba!” exclaimed Singe.

I have been bitten

watch out. the king is walking towards the trap warned bwila. oh my goodness. he cannot see the trapped snake, observed bwila. let us warn the king. suggested singa. but how. asked dzela. help somebody help me. cried king bingiza in agony. i have been bitten by a snake. the kings caretakers quickly carried him to the sick room. immediately call for a doctor. the king shouted.

It is poisonous Indeed

Doctor Mamba entered. the king’s sick room. “Let me first see the snake.” requested the doctor. “There it is.” pointed Fwipi to a three meter dead black mamba. “It is a very poisonous snake indeed,” Stated Masamba. “Treatment will take over two weeks”

Slaughter all the Chickens

is that so. responded fwipi however i have a special request to make the doctor muttered. what is it doctor. asked fwipi. can you please prepare some food for my entourage for the week we will be attending the king. request masamba. no problem responded fwipi. nganga can you please come closer, i need to discuss something with you. shouted fwipi how many chickens do we have in the pen asked fwipi. we have fifty five sir. responded nganga. we have to slaughter all the chickens to feed the doctors entourage. ordered fwipi. All the chickens on the farm were slaughtered.

Forty goats were slaughtered

The condition of king Bingisa got worse. Many people from neighboring kingdoms flocked to Chirunga to see the sick king. The men and women responsible for preparing food for the guest presented a problem to Fwipi. “Sir we have run out of food to save the guest. what should we do?” “Hold on, let me first find out.” responded Fwipi. Once again he called for Nganga. “Nganga do we have some chickens in the pen?” Fwipi queried. “Sir remember you told us to slaughter all the chicken,” Replied Nganga. “Okay, how many goats do we have in the kraal?” Fwipi enquired. “We have sixty sir.” replied Nganga. “Please slaughter all the sixty.” ordered Fwipi. “We are overwhelmed with guests,” The sixty goats were slaughtered.

The root cause of the problem

the kings condition grew worse to the point that he could no longer speak. Doctor masamba summoned the chiefs council in private. ladies and gentlemen i have tried all i could. i have administed the strongest drug possible to no avail. narrated the doctor defeatedly. however, one last thing. we have to do is to find the root cause of the illness and get rid of it. maybe we can save the king. the doctor paused. If i may ask you gentlemen who planted the trap in the kings palace the members of the kings council looked at each other without saying a word. the ancestral spirits say the person who brought this spell into the palace will have to be banisheed from the kingdom. he will be required to take with him the trap he bough this is the only way we can save the ailing king. commanded doctor masamaba who planted the trap in the palace. masamba repeated the questions. again there was silence okay then we have to try and ask the sick king himself. maybe he can hear our words and speak out.

Pointed towards one man

The doctor and the chief’s council entered the king’s sickroom. “Your majesty. if you are able to hear us.” Doctor Masamba spoke in a low tone. “The spirits are asking, who among us brought this spell into the kingdom?” There was silence in the room. Suddenly the king opened his eyes slightly. He raised his arm weakly and pointed the frail fore finger to the trap. Then he slowly directed the arm towards the chief’s council. The frail fore finger pin pointed one man; Fwipi. Then it slowly came down to a rest. As the arm was coming to the rest, so was King Hingisa joining his ancestors.

The cows slaughtered

many people came from far and wide to attend the funeral. these included kings from neigboring kindgoms. the kingdom was overwhelmed by the attendants. the chief council agreed to slaughter all the cows to meet the overwhelming demand for food.

Banished

As the cows were being slaughtered. Fwipi and his family were being driven out of the kingdom. It was clear that he was responsible for the had spirit in the kingdom. On instruction from Doctor Masamba. Fwipi was forced to take with him the trap and the dead snake.

Crowned Heroes

as fwipi and his family was being banished from the kingdom. another family was entering the glory of victory. although they were frail and almost dying pf hunger. their hearts were filled with a sense of victory. the fact that the mice family has not eated since the trap was discovered in the palace. did not stop them from dancing using the little energy left in their bodies. they breathed the fresh air of freedom. for the first ime they set their feet on the sacred palace as they sang a new song of liberation. they were on their way to present honorary degrees of hersoism to the three brave mice who pursuded the path of freedom o matter what they sung zomwa anachita bwila anabewula fwipi beu beu beula fwipi zomwa a singa anachita anabewula fwipi. zomwe dzera anachita anabewula fwipi. the stuggle continues…
