This books is dedicated to my readers young and old. It can be difficult making choices in the 21st century when you are surrounded by so much. So much information, so much stuff, so much people and so much of everything. SFL, S4L or Spreadsheets for life is a mental model that eases the burden of choice paralysis. This is nothing new, but i simply gave it a name. Spreasheets for life works for everyone and it will certainly work for you.

Does this sound familiar? You are trying to buy a product, but you dont know which one to buy. That right there is called choice paralysis. It happens multiple times and not just when you are shopping.

Power at your finger tips

The first demonstration of this mental model will be in the battle of Android vs iOS. Place your feeling aside and just stick with me. When it comes to smartphones or anything its all about what is truly important to you. What is important to you override any type of argument. Its not about how someone else feels or what facts someone points out, but what is truly important to you. In fact what is important to you is more selfish that it overrides basic reasoning. This isn’t about selfish reasoning but reasoining based on comon sense. Although common sense is a rare commodity it is still quite frankly common. Just as regular water will never be replaced by flavored water, sports drinks, and beverages. That is the kind of common sesne i am reering to.

The following examples uses real information, but fictional character to convey the point. To combat choice paralysis.
