# 2020 Madness

Dedicated to my younger self. I was a pessimist all my life and all i desired was to live a simple life and die peacefully. I wish i had never traveled, but thats not true. Traveling enabled me to break the limiter that was placed on my mind. My pysche was opened and the range of possibilities were endless.

If you watch a video and dont apply it. You are no different than someone who is blind.
If you listen to a podcast and dont apply it. You are no different than somane who is deaf.
You cant consume your way to a better life. You have to create it. 
the Human Brain is a supercomputer. Use it or You Will lose it
What do you want to do before you die?
If I died today, what would i regret?
Is college the only way?
how can i learn faster?
Why do people struggle with money?
Who would you be without your excuses?
if God is for me, who can be against me?
Why Not?
Is blank more important than your health?
is blank more important than sleep?
A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts
the love of money is not the root of all evil but the lack of it is
If you dont like how things are change them you are not a tree
there is no failure only feedback
when you are young work to learn not to earn
if you want to go somewhere find someone who has already been there
it does not take money to make money
Exercise cant cure diseases, but it can help you prevent most of them
If you dont care about privacy, its no different than being a porn star
the best expenses are business expenses

Linux Distros
 My world view was limited. I thought the only operating systems that existed on planet Earth were Mac OS and Windows. I hated windows and i still do. The list of reasons is endless, but the main reasons are forced updates, perfomance issues,frequent app crashes, lack of customization, poor security, too much bloatware and its just bad for privacy. Then i though to myself, i should probably switch to Mac OS. The process of doing so was brutal, especially if i decided to do it on my PC. Apple laptops (Macbooks ) are damn expensive and the hackintosh route is not good either. I did what any person would do, I went online to look for alternatives. To my surprise Linux was this huge community that i had never heard about. Turns outs there are multiple linux operating systems or linux distributions out there. The number exceeds 1000. I wasnt a fan of reading, so i watched some YouTube videos on the process. I was convinced and so i made the choice. I made a bootable USB using rufus and proceeded to wipe my entire system and rebrand it with new life, Xenial Xerus (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). The process was smooth, but then came the hardware issues. I couldnt change a couple of things like brightness, but luckily enough the forums had just the solution for that. It was my first time using this thing called a terminal. It was a new learning experience and my mind was at ease. Eventually i learned about Virtualbox and virtual machines. I tried a couple of distros in virtual box and some i installed on my host system (main OS). I learned about desktop environments and it was just fun.  I hopped distros, until i landed on something that had no problems. The distros that i tried include Kali Linux, MX Linux, Elementary OS, Parrot OS, Ubuntu Budgie, Lubuntu, Deepin OS, Manjaro, Linux Mint, Fedora, Bodhi, Zorin, Solus, KDE, antiX, Xubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, Robolinux, NixOS and Ubuntu Studio. 
I have tried multiple distros, but the one that i havent tried yet is Arch Linux. I’ll try it sometime in the future and maybe, just might switch to it. 
At the time of writing any Ubuntu version beyond 18.04(bionic beaver) has less issues than the previous. The coolest thing is being able to use wifi without the need to tether to a phone or modem. The other cool thing is being able to login to public wifi through a captive portal login. I am currently using Pop OS as my main OS. Its based on debian (Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa). I have been using linux for almost 4 years and i dont plan on going back. Any device that i buy, i will immediately replace it with Linux. In the future i, i do plan on building a sick PC and buying Crossover. Crossover is like wine, but more windows apps work, especially the premium ones. Why am still using linux? I am actually starting to go into software development, what better OS than Linux? 
I regulary try new apps, but at the moment i have.
Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text Editor (paid), Alacritty (terminal), Figma- linux, Inkscape, Gimp, Calibre, Snap Store, Audacity, Ranger, Calcure, Godot Engine, LMMS, 
Mostly development apps and a couple of graphic design tools
I prefer Snap packages over flatpaks, appimages and traditional debian files (.deb). I do have just about every file type above
I recently got into window managers and boy is it fun. Turns out window tiling managers offer better perfomance than desktop environments. 
I am currently using Awesome Window Manager, but i still have a long way to go in terms of learning. 
I switched from Pop OS to Manjaro Linux Awesome Edition. One thing is certain, its super fast. I feel like i am finally able to utilize the full power of my laptop. Using Ubuntu or debian based distros only seals away the true potential of your system. There is a leaning curve, but its not too steep nor too shallow. Its just perfect. I will keep utilizing the full power of 
Application file size; Small (.rpm. .aur and .deb) , Medium (Appimage), Snap Package, Largest (flatpak).
GTL & Qt (widgets), display server (x or wayland), desktop environment
My journey with arch linux, manjaro to be precise. Based on the file sizes. I could tell which one was better. The community editions were faster than the official. it terms on speed the Bspwm edition reigned supreme and openbox soon followed. The file sizes of the installers (iso file) are as follows:
Awesome (2.3GB) (This is what i started with, but turns out there was something else much faster). KDE Plasma (2.9) , GNOME ( 2.8), XFCE (2.8), Bspwm(1.8), Cinammon (2.4), LXDE (2.1) , LXQT (2.2), MATE (2.5) , Open box (1.9)
f2fs - flash friendly file system

Android Multiverse
My Android journey can be traced back to my childhood. Android tablet - games (slambot).  That galaxy tablet was my first introduction into technology. Its the first device that i ever felt connected to. A few years later, i recall a feeling of excitement. I purchased my first android device ever. The galaxy S3. This  device was a work of art at the time. I remember going above and beyond to learn how my device worked. I wasnt just interested in the the communication bit. Having this device was my extension of humanity. I remember customizing it even further when i read about this thing called root. It essentially enables tyou to have full control over your devices in ways that were not possible. Rooting is the equivalent of jail breaking on iOs devices. I followed the procedures and everything was smooth. Developer settings. I used a one click root tool called Ministro that eanbled me to gain root access without the need for a computer. However, the process of the installing a custom recovery was best handled by a PC. Luckily enough, a flashing tool  made the job easier. I was ready to reign havoc. Exploring and playing with different bits. Just for the record i have installed over 13,000 apps ever since i creted my google account. Thats insane because i dont think anyone else has achieved that feat and more specificiallt in the span of 5 years. Even i dont believe it but the numbers and stats dont lie. Carrti

Decentralized Web
Thanks to 2020, i needed something to keep me occupied. Little did i know, that i would fall in love with web 3.0 and become an early adopter.

Comics are fun
A few years ago, i started reading. That may sound weird, but its true. How i started exactly, i will never know, but its one my favorite things to do. I was really into anime at the time, an artfrom that i immersed myself in in the year 2015. Anime never felt enough and i really hated the fillers and fan service (nudity). I remember talking to one my friends at the time and he said he reads manga, instead of watching anime. That friend was non other than Waleed Khan. I was fascinated by the arguments he brought up.  It truly made sense, but i eas never convinced.  Days went by and i was talking to one my acquitances, Maya Mokrech. She told me the same thing as Waleeed. I was convinced to give this manga thing a try. Everntually my anime addiction had stopped or other replaced by something else. Manga was just amazing and to my surprise they were right. The manga contains the story that the creator invisioned without any changes needing to be made for the sake of adapting it into an anime. I never kept track of reading list, until just recently this year 2020. The one thing i truly hated though was the fact that Myanimelist, Kitsu and other anime/manga database sites didnt have eveything.  I know this because i later got into reading manhwa just last year in 2019 and manhua in 2020. Thats were the whole idea of using spreadsheets came in and i have been able to keep track of things on my own terms. 
manga- japanese comics. right to left, black and white

webtoon is a platform, not a format
Tachiyomi is freaking awesome, i hope the sources stay alive
I wont keep the order of the stuff i read in chronological order, but i will include all the reading experience so far
Ajin (亜人)- this is a manga about demi humans or half gods if you will. The details about the origins of these demi humans isnt reveleade until later chapters from like 70. The story was quite fascinating, but i had to stop reading it for a while because the story wasnt progressing. Thats when i realized that immortality can actually ruin a story. When the protagonist and antagonist are both immortal, where the hell do yo go?
Arata Primal (アラタプライマル)- this is a manga about time travel. Everyone finds themselves transported to a time when prehistoric creatures roam. The main character has a special ability of creating fire and is overly optimistc about everything. I read it to simply kill time and the ending was satisfactory.
Berserk(ベルセルク)- This has got to be the darkest manga that i have ever read. The first chapter will get anyone to say WTF because of the sex scene, but the more you dive into its just fucking amazing. To some degree, i would say that KentarouMiura, the creator of berserk has a wild imagination. Its almost as if he went to hell and came back and used what he saw as material to draw his manga. At the current moment the creator is old and the update cycle is unpredictable. It might end soon, but i will keep reading till the very end. Even if the ending might turn out to be bad, the artwork is on a whole nother level. No wonder why its the best manga of all time.
Berserk of Gluttony(暴食のベルセルク ～俺だけレベルという概念を突破する)- A manga about a character who gains the power of Gluttony (fits into the whole 7 deadly sins narrative). He is overpowered just like a similar manga called overlord. He can steal the abilities of the people or villains that he fights. There is not much to say about this manga because its currently on huatus and at the time of writing its less than 30 chapters.

Bucket List
The ongoing bucket list
What i plan or have already accomplished this year
    • Createed a spreadsheet to keep track of all the data consumed and created
    • Switched from Debian based distro (Ubuntu Budgue,Pop OS and Elementary OS) to Arch linux based distro (Manjaro Awesome edition)
    • Bought a new laptop (system 76 ) and camera (mirrorless)
    • Super Psyche Mobile App
    • Bought 2 Unstoppable Domains (I have to create a website though)
    • Couple of ideas (ipfs.33nano.io, 33nano.io, hyper://33nano.io)
    • Purchase a peer name address
    • Completed family tree
    • Ask the people of 2020 (book idea)
    • Extensive poetry anthology
    • Honest Meditation Idea

The Final Message
It has been great writing this book because i needed somewhere to put my thoughts. I noticed that just using spreadsheets and calendars wasnt enough. This book would surely help and it does. Eventually, i developed the app that i always wanted and i use that every day. I made it completely free and i dont plan on making it paid. I have consumed a great deal of information and i still do because the brain was built to learn. The brain is Gods greatest gift to humanity, no wonder why he made s
