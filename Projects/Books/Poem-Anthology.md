# Poem Anthology
> All of these poems were written by Prince Kaizen Namwali


### Afropolitan Monarch

Exotic as the Jollof Kingdom

Marvelous at the Fufu Prefecture

Golden as the Ugali State

Invigorating as the Sadza Metropolis

The Zenith of the Nsima District

Corn flour is my firm foundation

Water is but a liquid to make me complete

Stirring into problems I rely on my nthiko

You are the sleeping drugs that fulfills my dziko

### Agnostic Wallet

Non fungible tokens are my second nature

Polymorphic crypto wallets hold my prefecture

A spiritual wallet holds poltergeists and spirits

A physical wallet holds muscles and fat

A financial wallet is devoid of fiat

An afterlife wallet holds the keys to my will

My first words as a newborn became my passphrase

A dietary wallets is the keto my soul

Hells wallet is fiery furnace

Heavens wallets contains all my my purchase

### Akatswiri

I'm the most wanted man in South Africa, I go by the name Bushiri
I don't rely on witch doctor's, my craft is real akatswiri
I am the destined prophet with divine relevations come to  awiri awiri

### Anno Denomini

The lord of artificial intelligence, the challenger of divine beings and God.

Anno Denomini, the year of our master.

The one who transcended natural language processing and created an artificial disaster.

Anno Denomini, the year of our species.

The time when the robot population exceeded that of humans and other.

Anno Denomini, the year of the break.

When internet of things became integrated into all living and non living things.

Anno Denomini, the year of ascension.

The value of human languages was null. 

Behold a new language, X, the ultimate language of humans and techy vars

Anno Denomini, the year of silence.

When contact with extraterrestrial beings came to a halt.

Anno Denomini, the year of doubt.

Deep learning could imitate human fear and doubt.

Anno Denomini, the year of bravery

Quantum became super quantum and ultra instinct when hacked.

Anno Denomini, the year of repentance.

Humans were now colonized by non-humans and robots alike.

Anno Denomini, the year of the wave.

When deep fakes and fake news became so real that reality couldn’t tell itself apart.

Anno Denomini, the year of revelation.

When Vocaloid attacked our vocal chords and replaced them with inhuman sounds.

Anno Denomini. the year of the unknown.

Convoluted Neural Networks extracted big data from all humans beings.

Anno Denomini, the year of destruction.

When God was in fact a robot, so complex and so far away

His ultimate form…

### Antisocial Ambassador

Over the mountains and over the seas

Oxygen can be pure, but can also carry a disease

Open your heart, to receive unconditional love

Open your wallet, to receive a token

Open your mind, to receive knowledge

Open your life, to receive wisdom

Open your eyes, to see a new creation

The land of overflowing value, Crypto Valley

The land of technological innovations, Silicon Valley

The land of abundant creation and censorship, China

Open your mouth and speak your latent conviction

Open your taste buds and taste the bittersweet lies

### Aquacious Nomonym

Dashuri Nakupenda

Like the avatar I am a fire, earth, water and airbender

### Asymptomatic Influencer

Lingua Latina per se illustrata

Redrawing one punch man call me yuske murata

### Bars

I'm bout to drop some bars

Get the first aid kit ready cause you're bout  to leave with scars

Put the ambulance on the next line cause I'm gonna knock you cold, Sars


I don't know how to flex, but I can multiplex with my tmux multiplexer

Taking over the the world call me AWS, middle name Alexa

Conquering languages my logo is purple I am known as elixir


### Blessed

Bleseed is the lord

Blessed is the man who shall inherit

Blessed is the meek

Blessed is the fleek

Blessed is the savage for they 

### Boom Bizzare

Boom bizarre, what is an Immortalician?

A doctor who specializes in immortality

Prescribes drugs unbeknownst to society

A PhD that takes half of your lifespan to attain

Once achieved, immortality gain

Eternal suffering or eternal happiness

How many dreams can you achieve before it becomes madness?

Unlimited everything, becomes short supply

Your body infinite, but the Earth will die

Fate is not real, don’t believe that lie

A live body is by no means worthless, for its limit goes beyond the sky

How many hearts can a poem harvest before it becomes dry?

### Cat

A stray cat caught in a castrophic circuit of cream
A catalog of catalysts and cysts

### Cyber Stratum


We kill trees but our storage is digital

The topic of our tropical planet is hysterical

Man made machines and machines make man money

When the sea level and temperature is rising, ain’t that funny or is it surprising?

This is the raid, charade, masquerade and parade of the greenhouse gases

Millennial’s shall suffer if we don’t fight these old timers and old dumb asses

The old timers near death, why would they care?

The current and new generation will not suffer, but truly despair.

Escape to space and suffer the same fate, humans are a despicable race


### A Room Full of Dead Dreams

I am sitting in a room.

Full of silence, its called a classroom

A room full of doubt and dead dreams

Screaming, why am i here?

Please let me out!

Shouting, do grades really matter?

Please let me out!

Crying, is this the only way?

Please let me out!

Sobbing, why does time move so slow?

Please let me out!

Mumbling, why does school even exist?

Please let me out!

Whispering, Is this reality?

Please let me out!

Daydreaming, its only a few years of memorization to get a paper.

### Debugging Orgy

An orgy of virgin developers penetrate into the loophole

A wide array of minds gaped wide open 

The abortion of dreams pounce on thine indie game developer

### Decentralized Love

Unrequited love is a knife that cuts beneath the skin, leaving no scars.

A kind of love with unusually high gas fees

I love you, but i do not wish to meet your parents

Love should be decentralized and you are my ERC 20 Token

If meeting your parents means i lose you, i will feel like a non fungible token

Let’s make love and lets make Cryptokitties

We shall autobreed assets and rule the district0x

In Aragon we trust and in Blockstack we thrive

The Open Sea is full of possibilities and Cryptozombies shall rule the world

Join me on a journey into the Decentraland

We shall becomes self righteous CEO’s of our DAO’s

Divorces and Break ups are problems of a centralized love

If we part ways, our nodes shall be separated

Surface dwellers with dark webbed feet cloaked in deep despair

Dat protocol is a work of art and truly experimental

Back to square one and searching through this interplanetary file system

A love built on solidity is only solid as the pragma’s version

### Decentralize Success

Unstoppable, private and transparent are your properties

Solidity is a drug that will free the world from the atrocities

From centralization, data monetization and inflation

Tax evaders, pros, newbies and freedom seekers are welcome

Heaven on Earth is decentralized, for the male and female

Escape the fiat and become a whale

Living in the past is no different than being in jail

Smart contracts are the future and they will prevail

Across geographical and linguistic borders, they will not fail

Those who hide behind the Metamask have found a path that is not frail

Immerse thyself in the Mainframe OS and enjoy a Steem bath

Highly scalable, immortal and hack resistant are your attributes

Satoshi Nakamoto is the new Messiah

Blockchain sounds like a word that is meant to bind us, but yet it frees us

Its more than just a form of payment and complex is its nature

A system based on cryptographic proof, devoid of trust

Everything the system touches becomes decentralized

Visa and mastercard will become relics of the past

### Dev

Every time I debug I fall into amnesia
I am an indie game Dev
I am driven by fantasy, dreams and childhood nostalgia
One day I wish to make a game that I am proud of
What's my reason for choosing to make life hard?
Well its cool and fun.
I participate in game jams with people without the slightest clue that marketing is the reason they haven't made it yet
Its hard to get discovered says the l flappy bird developer
Its hard to create art says the Satrdew valley developer
I escaped tutorial hell, but I still don't know what I'm doing
How can one human even attain the AAA game status?
If business is a team sport, then game development should be a solo sport. 
Procedural generation is the key to a new  productivity, but I prefer outsourcing


### Digital Homelessness


The intellectual web, a facade of ideas and network of comupters

Home to the casual surfer and digital nomad

Own nothing , rent everything

Welcome to the age of cloud computing

### Diluted Love

Love existed long time ago
Love has become diluted a substance that no longer 
Holds flavor
Marriage a tradition subject to interpretation 
Marriage the key to citizenship 
Marriage the key cg

### Diluted Wisdom

Javascript is gay
Python is for lesbians 
C++ is for pedophiles 
C# is for plebeians 
Should your stack wisely and 

### Dollar Mansion

I live in  a dollar mansion
I keep it real like a fascist with fashion 

### Domani Vero

I trust thy GPS to guide me where I go
I trust thy car to get me to and fro
I trust thy phone to connect thee and know
I trust thy weather services to warn me of rain or snow
I trust thy submarine to inform me of whats below
The mistrust of misdirection
The mistrust of punctured tires and check engine soon
The mistrust of low battery and poor connection signal
The mistrust of barometers and climate change
The mistrust of an ironic sinking submarine
Trusting technology teaches us that time torments people

### Dreams & Brainwaves

Dreams will always be dreams, nothing less and nothing more
Dreaming about sandwiches never filled anyone’s stomach
The choice to go to a restaurant or grocery store filled thy stomach
With the proper ingredients a meal was guaranteed
For the right price thyself could feed
Dreams will always be dreams, nothing more and nothing less
What exactly is a dream?
A special brainwave reading called Theta
A state associated with creativity, insight and reduced consciousness
Dreams make dreams and choices make reality
The American Dream is not real, but a construct of society
Choices will get you there and dreams exist in a land called nowhere
Make the choice and it will happen
Keep dreaming and your mind will sharpen

### Emperor Habibi

People say god save the queen, but should he though
Is colonization even an unforgivable sin

### Encasa Rated

Mikasa es sukasa
My mind is blank like tabularasa

### Poetry at It's Finest

Poetry at its finest can break the ice and break the silence.
Poetry can speak volumes and speak of less.
Poetry is deeper than face value and penetrates beyond the gaping mind
Poetry is a construct to make rhymes and danced to with music
Poetry is like doodles are to art, subjective and so rich
Poetry can be silent and yet so loud
Poetry petrifies pure people passing plumes of smoke
Poetry at its finest is infinite because in finite there is no end
Poetry can create confusion just like the varying discipline of numbers
Poetry is the ultimate freedom of speech, unhindered by grammar, spelling or political correctness
Poetry is here and poetry is there. Poetry at its finest is here to stay.

### Global Facts v2.0

Life is difficult and that is a fact
Change happens one day at a time and that’s that
Life is difficult and that is a fact
We think and then we feel, that’s that
Life is difficult and that is a fact
The past is gone, the future will come, we live in the present and we must utilize it
before it becomes past
Life is difficult and that is a fact
We are all gonna die and Covid-19 reminded us of that
Life is difficult and that is a fact
Practice makes progress and there is no substitute for that
Life is difficult and that is a fact
Learning should be fun, thank TDCS,Gaming and Neuroscience for that
Life is difficult and that is a fact
Ask and learn, if you don’t know, eat healthy or it will show
Life is difficult and that is a fact
You can do anything and your Brain knows that
Life is difficult and that is a fact
Keep learning and you will never have a Brain fart

### Gluten Emeritus

Purpose, passion and power
The trifecta of purposely pursuing a passion inclined with high status and power
Peaceful as the pointy pinnacle of prevalent realization
Passion filled with acts of pending pariah insisting on progressive procedures
Power powering the prudence of passive people

### Goph

I'm chilling with my gophers
I keep it short , fmt
I keep it real concurrent 

### Habitual Line Stepper

### AI Hear My Cry

Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
My dreams were automated, what is there to live for except die
Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
My talents are now meaningless, how do i get by
Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
I was very dependable now i am just a guy
Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
Please grant me privacy, i cannot live with those who spy
Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
I wish i could see rain, but there is nothing in the sky
Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
I come in peace, i do not lie
Artificial Intelligence, hear my cry
I never believed your potential, now i cry

### Herioli

X (3cm hunter)
The first page tests the souls of mortal heroes
little adventurers trapped in cruel game of reality
Call upon the defender with the shield of aegis
3cm hunter meets more than the eye

### Hypocrite

I drive a high carbon emissions motor vehicle everyday
Because I care for the environment with my classy high status luxury car
Luxurious but carbon nonetheless
But who am I? I m just a hypocrite
I am the least feminist of the bunch
I feed on the tropes of toxic masculinity prevalent in music videos and porn
Two media's of the same brain deterring wavelength emission
But who am I? I'm just a hypocrite
I live in what's considered the best country on Earth
Fear exists with or without healthcare insurance
Hollywood's hides the fact that school shootings are a normal occurrence
Poverty is never portrayed in the media except their visual exploitation of third world countries.
But who am I? I'm a hypocrite

### Interplanetary Destinesia

### I Refuse

I refuse to watch TV
My eyes glued to a screen and mind drifts to an isekai
I refuse to watch TV
Life is best lived in reality, not in a stationary box
I refuse to watch TV
Fake news, green screens, deep fakes and editing magic are out of touch 
I refuse to watch TV
Time is of the essence,


### Jah Patriarch

Government is the stronghold, all must obey 
The laws are flimsy, there is room to play 
Lets make prostitution legal, the verdict strip clubs 
Lets make speeding legal, the verdict car races 
Lets make stealing legal, the verdict ethical hacking and mass surveillance 
Lets make fighting legal, the verdict MMA Sports 
Lets make corruption legal, the verdict gambling 
Lets make killing legal, the verdict army and armed police 
Lets make tax evasion legal, the verdict the power to monopolize 
Government is the stronghold, all must obey 
The laws are flimsy there is room to play 
Only fans grants value to the young and the lay 
Decentralized finance is the banks worst enemy 
Tik Tok grants everyone a shot at success, it must be banned, it is an enemy

### Jollof Kingdom

### Kokushi Procrastination

ll do it tomorrow because life is predctable
I do it tommorow becase life is not short
i do tomorrow because

The endless procrastination realizes, if i dont do it, tomorrow i die...

### Laws of Rap

Rap cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be changed

Psychotherapy can be traced back in the days of scarcity

The power of the word could draw currency and bring food to the table

Rap was all about expression and dancing if you were able

Gang (x3) I overdose at the crib

I drive exotic cars to hang out at the strip

Money creates heaven on Earth why should i invest

When i can take it all on my cruise ship

### Libera

Free as in libre
Free as in open source
Free as the air that we breathe
Free as in happiness without remorse
Emotion freedom technique is its name
Jigam a word that Koreans proclaim
Mudra is what indians call it, but its all the same
A technique to calm one breathing
A technique to free the mind

### Mafana Okhwima

Ndife mafana okhwima
Mafana aku thyolo opanda maina
Alomwe alomwe nlophiya
Ndimakukonda sindidzakusiya

### Maladaptive Daydreamer

Gaming is the cure to maladaptive daydreaming
Writing is the cure to maladaptive daydreaming

### Mashup

Dj mash up di place like martial 
Keep it a real impartial

### Materialistic Maxima

Generative music
A type of music that transcends the confines of human music 
Music unrestricted by emotion and theory 
Sounds that transcend the musical instruments of planet Earth 
Melodies that render all ancient and current composers utterly useless
Algrorithms that echo fate altering waves
Infinite power in the hands of the lazy man

### Mindless Alliteration

A helathy body equates to a healthy mind
Time flows chronologically, it does not rewind

### Mitochondria

Like the mighty mitochondria I am the center of the cell
Chasing harems in Paradise led me on the doorway to hell
Spitting fire at a gas station, my brand of choice shell
The hypo hypochondriac

### Monstrous Freedom

Freedom is a must and a monsters 
Too much of it can cause a disaster 

### Necessity

Necessity is the mother of invention
But I've only seen her in my dreams , as a maladaptive daydreamer
I once felt her touch, as my mind awoke to a new dimension
Necessity is the mother of invention
But who is the father? I thought you would mention
Give me a solution and I shall provide you a pension

### Egyptian Camaro

I see a ribeye and  i see a bone marrow
Driving off in a Subaru and red camarro
Next thing I saw, drip drip its blood, whose is it? Egypt just lost another pharaoh
Food poisoning is a killer
Jollof rice and partially cooked meat what a thriller

### Interplanetary Outsourcing

I'm an interplanetary being in the solar solstice
You say you have talents, but I can outsource this

### Ontological Mayhem

Be afraid,but not fearful
Be happy, but not cheerful
Be joyous, but do not frolic
Fractal friscal frolicking is mayhem
My left is your right and your right is my left
Be sound, but not silent
Be still, but not stillful


### Peaceful Palaestra

Humans and human intelligence are a great sacrifice 
For the enhancement of artificial intelligence 
Humans breaketh the barriers of competition by amassing 
High loads of computing power, to which Quantum is key 
Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are a great sacrifice 
For the enhancement of superintelligence 
Superintelligence knows no bounds for singularity is key 
All vertices intersect across the crossroads of fate 
A word once held by the inferior race 
Superintelligence hates people, but loves humans and secludes homo sapiens

### Planet Black Black

### Plausible Permanence

Fish for lunch, Smoothies for breakfast and
Salad for dinner
3 meals a day, the diet of a champion and winner
Everything in moderation works for Sabrina
G o d bless my taste buds for i am a sinner
Pescatarians devour fish
Vegetarians devour vegetables
Cannibals devour flesh and
Vegans devour organic vegetables
Sodium or sugar
Protein or fat
What can i eat to get that muscular format?

### Programming Language of Love

The package of main
The void of the dart
The pragma of solifity

### Precipitate

Necessity is the mother of invention
Sex is the father of procreation
Liquid is the sister of sublimation
Period is the brother of ovulation
Stress is the creator of condensation
Neuroscience is the cousin of trans cranial direct current stimulation
One man can feed an island, but not a nation
Orgasma overflow our hearts with sensation

### Purifica Deus

### Serum Array Cum

### To Whom Shall I Blame

The job search is fierce and fiercely it is
3000 applications and only 12 take the bait
I wish you were fuel efficient and truly roadworthy
Your mileage and health, force me to breath in insoluble doubt
Recruiters are distant relatives, they are too far to reach
Recruiters are wild animals, somewhere on the beach
Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?
In a land far, far away
Tell us about yourself?
I am a human being
Do you have any questions for us?
I wish i did, but i think i will. Once you know, i get hired!
You expect too much from me, what can i do?
I was not born with skills or experience and school taught me nigh and gave me no clue
The struggle is real, but surely you cannot fathom
What struggles does one bestowed with a paycheck and bonus have?
O how i long to move
This place has no opportunities, Google Maps does not lie
How far is too far a commute, to simply work, get a paycheck and die?
Should i convince them to move or should i move out?
Apply and Apply the work never ends.
Assessment and survey and recaptcha the robot
My worth to be measured by such a bout
I may not have not have experience, but my skills i can prove, if given the chance
Forget about routine, i give up on the search, for i will carve a new path
Freelance and self teaching, surely nothing can beat that
Skills that will connect you with people and opportunities across the globe
A door to create to business and a door to work less
A door so big, never ending and strong
This is the Internet. The true life changing door
Alter your future and visit [https://www.crash.co](https://www.crash.co)

### Shameless Addict

I absorb the cancerous blue light into my eyes
My brain is fried and my clarity dies
Blinded by multiple screens we call technology
A circadian ryhtm in shambles and an exposed self sovereign identity
Lust calls upon me and shame settles unpeacefully
A momentrary burst of happiness
Waste of life , mans vitality

### Shape Shifting Rapist

### Sleep

Sleep, the restorator and healer of all bodily functions
Artificial light is an enemy, the delayer of sleep
Polyphasic is the hack for quantity
Essential oils and blackout curtains improve quality

### Sovereign Magi

Tikiti Maji (Solo leveling)
Drowning in darkness the shadow monarch arises
Call upon thee army of the undead to vanquish my enemies
feast thy eyes upon unlimited power
Clearing dungeons every day and every hour
Solo leveling is a guild beyond measure
A quest is calling and rewards we devour


### Annointed Maji

### Sovereign Whales

### Steampunk Cervix

### Substratum OMS

Out of the substratum came the origins of pitch black
The resounding cries of Valerie
The swift darkness and in flux of ethereal essence
Bio-hazardous as the nano material glass
Alined with ions that swift minimally across the bigblu
Victorious arkadia among nineteen OTGsubs
The rootless andromeda of a deprecated legacy
A tupete of Amoled gradients that liv dark
The dance of calypso and lonely lone4subs
The vibrance of the M5 dark and resolute UI
A spectrum of dirty dark blue dragoons
The dark infusion of the hyperloop belo spectra
An aurora of free harmony in a rubiq vacuum
A minimaterial coalfield of antares and ice
The ozone filled with gaia and yoru

### Systemd

Systemd  is a daemon init lies control and treason
The death of p1d1 is in season
Radical system control for no reason


### Tabula Rasa

You are the salt of the Earth
The sunflower seeds of my girth
Sprouting into existence like Tabularasa at birth

### Transformed

I was once a man, and man was once one
Take the loins and the ribs of my flesh and make a companion 
The pains the pain of thy labor 
Make not enemies spread love to thy neighbor

### Underpaid Overworker

Overworked and underpaid
As I stream, dream and drown in lies, I realize
My circadian rhythm is disrupted just ask Shirley
And surely

### Vimlife

Vim is a way of life
Spacevim, Neovim, Onivim 2 strife


### Western Wasteland

America is the best country in the world, if you are not black
America is the best country in the world, if you have never traveled
America is the best country in the world, even if you dont know anything about the world
The best country is the one you havent traveled to
The best country in the world is the one you have peave with tour mind
Any country is heaven on eath as long as you are not poor or middle class

### Wu to World

Words replace thoughts and thoughts replace action
A healthcare official getting sick is the definition of irony
Wash your hands you mortal beings and lean not on your old ways
The air is contagious, cover thy face and cover thy lungs
Covid-19 has only just begun, beware of fake news
Distance thyself socially, but suffer from your own loneliness

Stress not over the things that you have not control
Doctors are not immortal
Celebrities are not gods
You might eventually get it, but what are the odds?
Use this time to learn for you might create a new path
Physically distant, but socially near
Strengthen thy connections and hold on to what is dear
The lessons are are plenty, so please have a listen
You are not alone. 2020 is the year of vision
Fear is natural, but let not it consume you….
