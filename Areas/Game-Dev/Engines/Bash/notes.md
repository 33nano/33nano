# Bash Scripting

> This folder contains all the files i created while i was learning bash scripting from the introduction to Bash Scripting book by Bobby Iliev.

One of the drawbacks i find of this book is that its geared more towards dev ops developers. 
At the moment i dont find any of the scripts with functions that were created in this book relevant to me. At least, not at the moment. I even wonder if bash scripting is necesary for game developers like myself. Still its a very dope resource and i cant criticize it much because its just an intro.

> I am learning bash scripting in the first place because i am curious about the automation part of it. This book doesnt do that, but it does provide great basics. I need to resume reading the book from page 41 (loops). Page 80 is the last relevant page of 122 
### What I Learned
- variables, functions, echo
- Ctrl + l = clear
- read, read -p, lots of regular expressions
- you dont have to memorize everything you can always reference it

### Book Examples; Irrelavant
- Executing bash scripts on multiple remote servers (Digital Ocean)
- Working with JSON in bash using jq (package)
- Working with cloudflare API with Bash
- Bash script parser to summarize NGIX and Apache access logs
- Sending emails with Bash and SSMTP

### Stuff i love
- Aliases ( i have lots of them, i will create more in the future, indefinitely)
- Neofetch (adds that bling to the terminal)
- Calcure (CLI Calendar)

### What I Want to Learn
> We learn because we have questions that we need answers. Its hard to learn, when you dont have any questions.
- automation
- Is is possible to create a visual novel in bash?
- is it possible to automate everything and are there limits to automation?
- The biggest reason has to be the fact that i love the T-UI launcher. I want to rewrite the app in Kotlin and see, if its possible to implement bash or other unix shells like fish and zsh.
