1. **What would you say is the number most important area in a persons life?**
- There isn't a single answer to this  question, but if there was it would be Brain Health. Its a subject that philosophers, doctors, scientists, theologians and just about every profession would agree upon. When your mind is at peace everything else in your life falls into place. It can also be quoted through James Allen's book, As A Man Thinketh, " A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts. As he thinks, so he is , as he continues to think, so he remains. " My favorite interpretations would have to be the title that Dr Daniel Amen used as his book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life. 

2. **Why do you value Brain Health so much?**
- I didnt think it was important at all in my life, until my curiosity drove me to learn more about the Brain. I have seen a number of people close to me ruin their lives all because they were unable to take care of their Brain Health or find the resources and support to assist them. The most shocking and vivid example is someone that I knew very close, decided to take his own life. How could a healthy man who was living a good life take his own life? What was going on through his head? If anyone ever disagrees or tries to dismiss that Brain health is useless, I feel the need to share the story, but if they can't empathize with that, perhaps their Brain health is already deteriorated and I can only wish them luck, not tragedy. 

3. **What's the value of exercise anyway, isn't it pointless?**
- I used to think that exercise was pointless and something reserved for people who wanted to be athletes, but I was wrong. The first time I ever participated in exercise religiously was in high school when a friend convinced me to join Track & Field. Before that time, the very act of exercising was something I only saw on television. The  euphoric moment came to me when I finished an intense workout and experienced the aftermath. My brain was in a state of flow, I felt like I could do anything and most importantly my whole body was pleased. Exercise has benefits that stretch far beyond the human imagination, heck its free, you can do it anywhere (indoors, outdoors, any country). Until you get to experience the clarity in your mind induced by exercise... Just do it! Exercise shouldn't be that thing you  regret doing.

4. **How often do you exercise?**
- I am slowly getting back into the habit of daily exercise thanks to Kaizen. Not as intense as it was during my high school years (2017), but still enough for those achieving the state of flow. 

5. **Whats the big idea with lifelong learning?**
- The concept is pretty simple, learn something new everyday, even the smallest bit can make a difference. When you stop learning, your Brain literally starts dying. The way lifelong learning works for me now is way different ever since I learned about the personal knowledge management system known as a Second Brain. Documenting everything is a mandate, some may disagree, but I don't. Simple things such as changing your default shell from bash to zsh. Creating a website using a static site generator like Hugo. Creating procedurally generated music and actually making money. 

6. **Why minimalism?**
- When I got to learn about this thing called minimalism, I had a euphoric moment. I was already a minimalist, before I knew what minimalism was. I guess the best to describe it is... I was already practicing or exposed to this thing in my life, but the only thing that changed was that I now learned or found the word to describe it. Growing up in Malawi, there was and hopefully still is one central theme; Relationship with people come first, everything else is secondary, especially stuff. Some might say God first, but the reality is we value those relationships(Bible fellowship, prayer warriors, Sunday school). 

7. **Is minimalism different around the world?**
- I honestly believe so, but some people do say that minimalism is subjective. Some utilize minimalism because doing the latter would be a financial burden (one meal a day...). Some utilize minimalism because it allows them the freedom of true focus and mental clarity. 

8. **What's your favorite flavor of Minimalism, if that's a thing?**
- I love the Japanese version of minimalism. Fumio Sasaki, one of Japan's most famous minimalists wrote a book entitled, Goodbye things. In the book you get too see him transform from a hikikimori to a hyperfocused minimalist. Even better is that he was  featured on Asian Boss, so I had the chance to see his actual lifestyle years after the book was published. 

9. **Do you think there is anything wrong with minimalism?**
- Some people say minimalism is bad for the economy, but I am not those other people I am a minimalist. I don't live to see or click on ads, I will buy something if its a necessity, not a desire, I don't want my attention to be split, I love having my focus. 

10.  **Why Financial Freedom?**
- Slavery cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be changed. Slavery today has evolved into contracts. The opposite of financial freedom is financial security, which turns out is a disaster (Covid-19)

11. Is Sleep really that important?
