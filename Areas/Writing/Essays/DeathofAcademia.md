1. **Why do you say, F••k college?**
- It served its purpose once, but now it ruins the lives of people

2. **What analogy do you think best describes college?**
- I think the analogy of religion goes perfectly well with college. College is a religion that surpasses the influence of every major religion in the world and somehow gaining a degree is tied to attaining Nirvana(Buddhism), Salvation(Christianity),

3. **Does academia as a whole possess a threat or is it limited to College?**
- Its tied to both. Homeschooling and self taught has come a long way that it doesn't make sense what college does

4. **Why do you believe people go to college?**
- magical thinking (cognitive distortion)

5. **What's your take on standardized testing?**
- F••k that. Its like a rite of passage into the religion that will teach you communism and cultivate your soul

6. **What would make you go to college?**
- One: Shorter! One year or less. F••k that 4 year S••t.
- Two: if I got straight into the classes that I want instead if trying to be ripped off by classes that the government wants you to take
- Three: if they taught about Block chain, decentralized applications, real world finance and stuff that really matters
- Four: offered a free trial

7. **Do people who graduate from college really own their degree?**
- No, they don't. Its like the banks, centralized currency, fiat currency. You have to believe you have control, but you don't.

8. **What was the original purpose of college?**
-

9. **What is the purpose of college today?**
- To make money while providing a useless service whose products is worthless. Its similar to those network marketing pyramid ponzi scheme organized crime business who make money through word of mouth social engineering while providing a nonexistent service and product.

10. **What will replace college?**
- Real education, reality...

11. **Will college ever be replaced?**
- Hell yeah, the future is competitive. Creators abandoning patreon in favor of only fans is a great example

12. **What's your stance on the college admissions scandal?**
- Its F•••••g pathetic. Its an example of privileged people displaying their lack of gratitude when they possess the connections and resources that far exceed any third party institution or credential to make it big in life. Its an insult to the poor, an insult to....

13. How much should one spend towards their education?
- Less than $20,000 maximum or only the amount can afford

14. Why are people in debt idiots?
- Because they choose to and having $150,000 is just F•••••g dumb!
