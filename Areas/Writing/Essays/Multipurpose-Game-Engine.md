# Is it possible to make a music video with a game engine?

https://i.redd.it/3e27y5t2uki61.png

Yes. I believe the best example is rainfall by stormzy. In the behind the scenes they talk about not having experience making music video, but having the curiosity about the process and seeing how they could implement that into a game engine. Just that thought alone had me thinking, thus the question which I never knew I had, was answered. 

In the video stormzy barely moves, I mean he takes a few steps, but the most is just stationary dancing. What really changes for the most part is the scenes and the transition happens to be a glitch type of effect that's pretty much a signature. The glitch effect in question has been used since the every first watchdogs game. 

Note: Its completely possible to make a music video without moving, a great example is the music video Like a bullet from a gun by skepta
