### Sonic Drive In

A restaurant that serves toxic food, while paying their employees below the minimum wage. "You should make the rest in tips" what kind of f•••••g restaurant do you think this is? Tips don't exist in fast food, why would greedy corporate ever see their employees as people. Do benefits exist? Thats like asking if a stripper doesn't have any venereal diseases. Free food up to the $8 limit, you mean a free heart attack? Say no to culinary rap3. Like a f•••••g machine I must operate with the most redundant prompt, "thanks for making my sonic, your sonic, this is the Overused Underachiever can I take your f•••••g order?" Learn to speak English damnit, man f••k you too. The most mediocre ear defeaning, ear deforming bluetooth headsets. Why the f••k do I work here? The quantitative workload does not equate to the amount paid, even f•••••g factories pay a decent wage. 

I hated everything about working at Sonic. Working there allowed me to experience what it's like to be a slav3. I experienced what it's like to work at a job that is is best suited for a robot, not a human being.The harsh psychological damage and brutal physical damage of working in fast food. Fast food is fast paced with even faster tempter tantrum of hungry savages, not customers. I don't give a s••t about their mission statement, it's not like they are doing the planet any good. Working at Sonic made me hate my life and I didn't need that f•••••g depression. I walked out during one hell of a soul sucking shift and I never looked back ever since. I'm glad I quit and my mind is freer.

> Lesson #1: Don't work in fast food, you'll be f••••d.


### Burlington
> Lowest paying retail along 

A retail store that sells used cheap clothing with even cheaper employees. I worked at Burlington out of desperation because I needed something to keep me afloat during the pandemic, but turns out that decision was bad. Before I began my descent into this s••••y retail store, I was working at the hell invoking lowest paying nursing home, Park Manor. Burlington promised an amazing wage from what I had read online, but the reality far from it.  Where the hell do I even begin? Every employee gets paid the same no matter the position, whether you work in the receiving area (sorting and tagging clothes), sales floor (recovering misplaced clothes) or front end (cashier), you make the same dough. The only exception to that rule is people with a managerial position they make $12 and up. The wage divide is to be expected anywhere, but equality? A man getting paid the same as a woman, o the blasphemy. The first impression of it was already displeasing and I thought nothing else would surprise until the cun7s of upper management decided to become more strict. I don't know if this was purely out of capital gains or due to the fact that the franchise as a whole was about to become bankrupt, who knows? All the upper management bunch is a 0rgy of f4t, g4y and laziest people that I have ever come across. My main responsibility was that of a cashier, a person who scans barcodes for a living using a keylogger. The POS had a bland interface and it tells you what you need to do at each process. A typical day is comprised of scanning s••t, pressing F6 to bring the payment option and pressing the corresponding function key for either cash, card or gift card. What should be a failry easy process takes an eternity to load on these archaic machines using an archaic programming language and s••••y servers. The burlington way is stupid because they have you ask people to sign up for a credit card, ask for a phone number and talk about some s••••y survey. The phone numbers and email collected are used for surveillance, yes they spy on their customers. For what reason, I don't f•••••g know. They even have the audacity to send people a newsletter just because they signed up to have receipts emailed to them, the f••••••g balls... What's even shocking was when I learned about doing returns which is stupid that the same people that check you out also give you money. In the unlikely event that someone is returning without a receipt and didn't leave a phone number we capture the persons identity. To my surprise they have a database of emails, phone numbers , bank account numbers and IDs. Surveillance capitalism doesn't only exist on the web, turns out even physical stores do it too, and a s••••y retail store at that too. A paying customer is not enough, they have the balls to collect people's information. Who knows they probably sell that information. Being a cashier was being turned into this convoluted f•••••g process when it should've been easy. . . On a weekly basis our cashier performance was reviewed on a bunch of s7upid minor detials. Why would the validity of the phone numbers matter? They checked that really?  Slowly and progressively I was growing tired of this f••••d up workplace. Secular music and announcements that played nonstop, Air conditioned controlled by corporate, smelly people (weed)... Day in and day out I would ask myself, why am I here? Sure the job was easy and couldn't possibly match what I had gone through at Perry's Steakhouse or tyson foods or f•••••g sonic at that. No matter how many hours I worked, all the money would go towards the bills and groceries, that's not living, that's slavery. No matter how much you work, you could never taste freedom


> Lesson #2 : Any job that can be automated is not a real job. A cashier is not a real job. It can be automated just look at self checkouts.

### UPS 
> F••k the system
Out of all the dilapidated infestations that have sucked away my precious time this was the place that I worked the shortest. In a mere few hours, the first day of orientation, I knew that this wasn't for me. I instinctively knew that no matter how desperate I was for employment, I wouldn't put up with it. I trusted my instincts and this time like most times, they never failed me. The notion of looking at a job and thinking to oneself, "this place seems chill, I bet it's a fun job doing that" later turned out to be the death of me. It was nearly the death of me , but I escaped before my soul went adrift

### Gas stations; Shell 🐚
> Just pray that you don't have to go to the bathroom
I was so close to closing in on this guaranteed job, but the details stirred me away. Why would you have me train at a different location when this is the closest location to me? I was given a walkthrough of the workplace, but the reality of having so much responsibility to oneself is absurd and the measly pay is not justified. 
### Perry's Steakhouse
> F••k fine dining

### Popeye's
> No ac is a feature rather than a bug.

The lavish days of walking out each day with boxes of artery clogging deep black oil guzzling fried southern genetically modified chemically induced chicken are gone. I worked at this place for a week and on the last I simply called my way out. The poor working conditions and stress inhibiting environment was all too familiar. Here I was again working at another fast food restaurant and everything was the same. All fast foods chains, no, all restaurants harbor the same soul sucking, stress inducing and human depriving principles
### Denny's
> Dishwashing should be easy, it's not rocket science

Day in and day out, I would walk out with soiled clothes, _at least my hands were clean,_ so I thought. Working at yet another restaurant and everything was the same, even if I was just a dishwasher. This was one of those , walk in and get hired on the spot jobs. A type of job that proves you don't need any qualifications, let alone a background check, just come as you are and we'll exploit you. My clothes began to carry a very strong and stench odor that wouldn't go away even after washing my clothes. I figured why bother looking nice, if no one can see me. This was the one restaurant were the only healthy thing on the menu was water, not even the salad, fruits or any of the food items on the menu. The s•••••••t part of the job was the extra responsibilities that don't make sense, for someone who is just supposed to be a dishwasher. Cleaning the restrooms, sweeping the outside and the worst of them all taking out the trash. You would think that cleaning the restroom would be worse, but it was the opposite. When you have all the proper tools to do your job, that thing that seems like cr4p ends not being too much of a deal as you visualize it will be. I had gloves and disinfectant. I would spray that s••t all over to mask the smell, especially the bloody period tampon infested women's restroom, that s••t was horrendous. Taking out trash was almost like a punishment. People would fil up trash to the brim and it contained all the food waste of anorexic twats, luquid waste, reused oil and those bloody tampons. The odor was so strong it felt like I was in Hiroshima after the nukes were dropped. Most times the trash bags would break in the process which was a total disaster. I hated dishwashing to begin with, I even hated the extra responsibilities even more. My final moment was when a corporate Indian c••t decided to teach me how to do my job. He brought some f•••••g stick that was supposed to measure some s••t like some damn litmus paper test and even brought a chart with some mathematical s••t. You have to be f•••••g kidding me! I acted like I was listening and he decided that he would wash the plates instead, while I watch. Ridiculous as it was, I slowly made my ascent to the exit because that day was final. I didn't have the guts to tell him that I quit because I probably would have cussed him out there and then. I simply told one of my coworkers to relay my message onto this corporate Indian c••t. I quit in style yet again by walking out, instead of calling in or talking to people in person.

## GRAND MESSAGE
> If you ever ask yourself "why am I here?" You're in the wrong place!

The problem is that I have purely been motivated by money and have worked jobs which I layer found that I hated. Seeking comfort I stumbled upon depression and hating my life, feeling like a victim. A mindless soldier who simply obeys laws and gets payed morsels of bread. 
Out of all the jobs I worked, I found recurring theme aside from the fact that I hated these jobs. I always tried to find a way to break the rules or the workload in order to save time or for the lack of a better not do too much. The problem that arose from that was countless warnings about doing it the way they wanted things to be done. I'm an outlier, an outcast , a person who thinks outside the box. I never understood why companies wanted to do things a certain way, when there was a better and faster way to do it. Upper management doesn't really care about that like the true capitalists that they are. I later came to realize that I am what's known as a knowledge worker. A person who utilizes their knowledge to live. All these jobs with the exception of one were jobs that required no growth just an obedient puppet who bends to the will of the puppeteer.

# Overused Underachiever

### Sonic Drive In

A restaurant that serves toxic food, while paying their employees below the minimum wage. You should make the rest in tips, Physically demanding. 

### Burlington
> Cheap clothes with even cheaper employees
Equal pay isnt equality...
Gay and strict management
Offline mailchimp: collecting emails for newsletters and sending receipts (database of emails)
They coect phone numbers for supposedly in case people lose their receipts, but in reality they actually those phone numbers. Customers paying isn't enough,they need more information from them (surveillance). 
A cashier is someone who scans barcodes for a living using a keylogger. 
Stats for phone number collection. They actually check the validity of the numbers, that's absurd.

<details markdown='1'><summary>Q&A</summary>

![](https://i.redd.it/dh8cwxg8b8w61.png)

1. **What have I learned from my countless job hopping?**
- Hourly jobs have a fixed income cap, even in the midst of inflation (affects cost of living)
- None of these places actually value their employee (puppets controlled by corporate)
- Commuting jobs suck
- I haven't learned anything from these jobs. That is a problem! If you work for a company that incapacitates your growth, i believe that is called a dead job. It literally kills your brain cells

2. **How is job hopping similar to distro hopping?**
- Like distro hopping most of the Linux distributions you encounter are preconfigured with a desktop environment, systemd, login manager and for the lack of a better word, bloat. Its impossible to make significant changes, but you can if you tried. Whereas installing arch Linux, arch Linux based distros or any distro that requires a DIY methodology, you have freedom. Your capabilities are endless, you are in control. Arch Linux is similar to working for a startup or a company that actually values growth not just of their client base, but also of it's workers.

3. **What were your expectations of working in America?**
- I didn't have high expectations, but I did think that it would be a pleasant experience at least. However, I heed to the fact/truth that my uncle told me, " working in America fucking sucks." Coming from a white man who is married to a Malawian the truth in this statement is undeniable.

4. **Why didn't you just climb the corporate ladder, instead of job hopping?**
- Freedom does not exist in climbing ladders, nor does it exist in job hopping. Freedom exists when you control your own living situation, unencumbered by corporate controlled puppets controlling your time, imposing a limit on your income 

5. **What would you say is the reason you worked at some of these jobs?**
- I was chasing comfort and because it was easy. 

6. **Do you hate the people you worked with?**
- Hate is such a strong word, I prefer the word dislike. I have come to realize that I simply dislike corporate because these people are just puppets of the f•••••g big dogs. Some of the people I have worked with are great and I still keep in touch.

7. **What would you say is your biggest regret?**
- Honestly, coming to America was a f•••••g big mistake because its the reason that I encountered all these problems to begin with. If someone had told me that all you need is the internet to build the life you want and you can even go offline after doing that. I wouldn't have bothered coming to build my life in a plutonomy.
