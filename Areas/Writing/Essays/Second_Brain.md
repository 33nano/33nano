The idea of a second brain is amazing, but something even amazing occured to me. What if? What if you could actually build a second brain or at least automate it? Imagine having a second brain that creates things for you, a brain that can make you money. I prefer to use the term second brain efficiency as opposed to the boring word of automation
I think i am definitely onto something. Why am i learning Go? I think to build a second brain would be great reason because concurrency is built in. A second brain definitely relies upon concurrency.
The main reason i think i am learning programming is because i am trying to figure ways to become lazy or at least free up my time, so that i can pursue more things in life. 

Like an intellectual capitalist my currency of choice is neurons formed by the neurogenesis of neuroplasticity. I lay to waste intellectual entertainment for its value is null. Maladaptive daydreaming was once a fiend of the past, but the markor of obsidian captured my wandering. The only form of intellectual entertainment that provides thee catharsis is gelotology because the patterns of neuro linguistic programming are acutely visible. The death of my excitement is tied to the relevation of trans cranial direct current stimulation, what a pity to be limited to the motor cortex, the overseer of motor skills.
Gratitude, the source of my happiness

# Productive Lazines
> This essay is about he pursuit of laziness, which coincidentaly turns outs to be more productive 

I would consider myself smart and lazy. Laziness and productivity go hand in hand. Laziness is what has allowed for great inventions in human history. The pursuit of laziness is what has brought about an easier lifestyle and less brain usage on humanity.This is something that i never could i have out, until i sat down and looked at my past.In school, i avoided reading a book as much as possible in favor of spark notes. I refused writing notes in college classes, if the content was posted on blackboard. I refuse buying textbooks because  i could easily find the material free at the school library. I refuse intensive studying because i could skim the content on Quizlet or bring a small cheating paper with me. At most of the dead end unskilled jobs i worked,i found ways to bypass the work protocols to make my job easier. When it came to writing essays i never felt the need to proofread and correct stuff myself, thats what grammarly is for. Manually citing sources suck that's what citation machine is for. Humans are progressively becoming lazy each and every day, every single year and yet we are concerned about artificial intelligence taking over. Artificial intelligence is actually a good thing because if you have an entity that can do everything for you, thats the ultimate form of laziness.

>Precognitive Dream- A dream that appears to predict the future

Crazy! That’s what most people would tell me. Drugs? I have a clean, healthy body and have never ingested anything apart from from food and water. None of which contained any drug like substance. Coincidence? I don't think so. If you ever have a precognitive dream its a clear sign that you need to analyze your lifestyle, habits and mostly clearly, You. If you dismiss it, it's probably meaningless right? I would definitely be called a psycho if I claimed that everyone has had a precognitive dream, but has no memory of it. Anyway, its my dream and is tailored towards me; Its subjective, like Art. The message is encrypted as the techies would say and i have the decryption key. Sharing the file would be meaningless because it uses a different cryptographic algorithm that can only be deciphered by the user or some people known as psychics. I can see vividly, experience widely and recall it, as if it was just yesterday. Was it a dream, a dream….

Why would a 30 year old be crying out of nowhere? When a man cries, it's a sign of weakness, the only exception to that rule is the death of a loved one or when one is in immense physical pain. Why would someone be crying when they see a reflection of themselves? Turns out, I wasn't looking at my reflection, but at the real me, the older version of me. By the looks of it, this man was to my assumption somewhere in his 30’s, but for the sake of simplicity 30. Why would the 30 year old me be crying after seeing the current me. By the looks of it, this man’s wounds were internally deep and he had experienced a reality not of his own choosing. This man had multiple strands of grey hair that had been developing ever since he was 10. Its wild, but I started producing grey hair at such a super young age. There i was, the full manifestation of my aging was this abundant grey hair. How could i get this man, i mean me to stop crying. I wouldn’t just say “grow up.” I sat on a bench beside him and simply stared around because there was no one around except the two of us in that moment. I turned my head towards his direction and he had stopped crying. He gently placed his hand on my forehead and the most magical thing happened. I was able to look through each of my memories that led up to the current man sitting beside me. Not all those memories were clear and some absolutely made no sense. Precognitive dreams aren’t in 8K 300 fps were you can see all the details and follow all the events. However, the one thing that truly made sense was that it wasn't my fault. For some reason i could tell what i needed to do, but i was left with the certainty of how to do it. The dream led me to purchase multiple books and ebooks. Every book that i read i loved, but i was left with the feeling of how do i apply it? I was looking for the answers on how to apply what i had just learned. The answer came to me in the month of July in the form of a book. I remember preordering this book back in month of May and had completely forgotten about it. The book arrived on a friday. I had work the following day, but i didnt feel like going. I recall making an excuse because i simply wanted to be in the moment and finish the book as quickly as possible. I didnt speed read and i recall finishing the book in 5 hours. Those were the best 5 hours of my life and they were similar to the ones i spent reading another book entitled Mind map mastery and watching a 20 minute video about the book Memory rescue. Everything from there on made sense, but what was holding me back? Fear. The fear that i am not good enough. Fear that i wont get recognition. Fear of the uncertain. Fear of my own skills. In August i set out to complete something specific each day, but i failed. I failed to do one thing for a single day. If the road towards a better life was to simply take one small step a day then i have missed out. As i write this it 12 september 2019. I realize that 3 months remains until next year. The probably was something bigger than just the lack of willpower. Each and everyone of those days in August i was losing a valuable element known as zinc. I lost zinc through a process that i know of to be my weakness or succumbing to instinct. September is the month that i quit that habit, subscribe to a gym membership plan, start intaking supplements, adopt a puree diet and overall be active mentally. I have come to realize my weakness and treat my troubled mind seriously. My mind can either make or break me. I knew this all along and its clearly stated by James Allens book, As a Man Thinketh. A quote that reads “A man is literally is what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts. As a man thinketh so is he. As he continues to think so he remains.” I figured out what to do with my life at the age of 19. I cant complain nor compare myself, although i do somewhat envy people who started so young and became super famous and accepted by society. All i can say is that i am glad i had someone to correct me. From today on i no longer have excuses.
