# Afropolitan Excellence

_Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds_ -- Bob Marley. Afropolitan excellence is an essay that aims to shed light in the darkness, give hope to the hopeless and promote the beauty of Afropolitanism.

There are countless Afropolitan figures, but the way the content will be structured is by fields and also country. I will try to avoid listing too many examples from America, because that's not a suitable environment and the narrative of the opportunity land is toxic considering the history and present, nothing has changed.
