Thank you everyone for being here! Prepare your hearts and minds for you are about to witness one of the best ted talks of all time. My name is Prince Namwali and i am a game developer. Today i would like to share with you two things that i made, a quote and an application. The quote that i am made reads, "If Neuro-Linguistic Programming is the programming language of the brain, then Rational Emotive behavior therapy is the scripting language of mind." Before i get into this, i would like to point out the difference between a programming language and a scripting language. A pogrammming language is simply used to create programs and a scripting language is used to extend the functionality of a program. For example a web browser is created using a programming language (its a program) and a scripting language, like javascript is used to extend the functionality of the browser. You can use javascript to build websites,extensions and even automate some browser tasks. Lets get back to the quote, but let me define the terms. REBT is this amazing tool that helps explain why we think the way we think, why we feel the way we feel and why we do the things we do. NLP on the other hand is the language of the brain and if used,helps to achive harmony with the inner voice in our head. NLP and REBT go hand in hand, like bread and peanut butter. The way that REBT works is using 5 letters, but the the sad reality is that most people only use 3 instead of 5. ABCDE - A stands for Activating events, B stands for Belief System, C stands for Consequence , D stands for Dispute and E stands for effect. To best explain REBT, we need an example of a scenario. We are going to look at what a scenario with only 3 letters looks like, compared to 5 letters. A young man suddenly gets fired and the result is devastating, he vandalizes the property of this workplace. Lets analyze it, the A- activating event is the act of being fired, lets jump to B - the belief system, what is happening inside this persons head, brain, mind. The belief system is usually hidden, but its something that is formed by how a person was raised since birth, This persons environment, peers and most influential, parents. I would like to introduce another term its called Tabula Rasa which means blank slate and its this theory about how when we are born, we are born with a blank slate (we know nothing). We slowly become who we are by the information we consume and our environment.  The belief system is what this person says to himself and in this scenario, it probably goes along the lines of, "you cant say that to me",  and its this series of thought that produce an undesirable consequence. This all happens within miliseconds by the way. How would this situation have been corrected or different? This is where, NLP comes in, in the form of the letters D and E. Dispute and Effect. Questions allow us to change our train of thought, despite the situation. The question enables us to think, but the question has to be applicable to the situation in order to create a better effect.
