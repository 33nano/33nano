Ladies and gentlemen my name is Prince Namwali and today I am going to teach you about something powerful that I learned recently about finding a career. What am I about to teach you will shock you and I mean that, but the truth is it's beneficial. The first shocking thing I would like to tell you is that, if you are still thinking and sending resumes thinking that you will get a job, may God bless your soul. If you don't believe in God, may karma weigh upon your soul. What you should do instead is create a value proposition and we create this in a form of a video. In the video you pitch yourself as a human being, not as a piece of paper. You are not a piece of paper listing things that you did formatted in whatever format you desire.
