1. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why do logical people consume diuretics?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- Coffee, beer, wine, tea
 </span>

2. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Eating out in restaurants is overrated!** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- It's cheaper and better to cook the food yourself
Why pay more for a one time meal, as opposed to buying ingredients that will last you for weeks, even months. </span>

3. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why do people have children when they can barely afford to keep themselves alive?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'> 
- The amount of children in orphanages just pains my heart and eyes
Asians have the right plan. The population decline of  south Korea, japan and other countries seems reasonable. The housing cost is high, it's quadruple just by having kids. </span>

4. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why do people still use windows?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- I moved on something better and I can say that </span>

5. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**I would rather own my software than be a slave to the cloud, internet or sass!** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-  </span>

6. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why do people still use resumes?**</span>
Only idiots are unaware of applicant tracking systems
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- </span>

7. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Your company shouldn't have a mission statement if you pay s••••y wages**</span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'> 
- </span>

8. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'> **Working in America f•••••g sucks.** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- With the same job you are able to make a living in another country. You need to have a f•••••g second job just to get by. Thats why people live paycheck to paycheck
</span>

9. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**You simply can't understand. You wouldnt care about something unless you know someone close to you who has gone through that situation**</span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- I care about brain health because I know someone who was close to me. If only he had gotten the help he wouldn't have taken his own life. Its the same with you wouldn't care much about cancer even  though you see people people wear shirts, participate in walks or other activities, unless you know someone very close to you who has that illness. </span>

10. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why the f••k do we let big tech control our personal lives?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
 - I f•••••g hate Facebook, they own Instagram and WhatsApp. They were better separate, but now it's a f•••••g mess. They won't even let you use Instagram as a full fledged desktop app to upload s••t. Consent is a word that doesnt exist online. We are constantly being raped of our data by large tech companies and eyes are being filled with a cumshot of ads. The worst part is that w 
</span>


11. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why the f••k do comic artists make their flashbacks so f•••••g long?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- I am totally fine with 3 to 5 chapters of flashbacks or occasionally tossing in a small flashback snippet, but I absolutely hate when a flashback is like 50 chapters. It makes me so mad, its like why didn't you just slowly build the story instead of waiting to f•••••g halt the progress. I stopped watching anime because I got so bored of all those character monologues, fan service ,the feeling you get after completion (now what?), and, worst of them all fillers. I stopped reading manga not because its black and white, but because I couldn't find any high quality works similar to Boichi. I was caught up to everything I was reading, I ran out of recommendations I was starting to discover stuff on own and probably because I fell in love with manhwa. _Finally some color_ I exhaled.

12. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**I'm not a minority, I'm a human being. What the hell is wrong with you?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- F••k America!
</span>

13. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why the f••k does the government want to control block chain technology?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- Governments all around the world especially the USA already suppress people as it, why the f••k do they want to suppress innovation as well? </span>

14. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'> **Shut the f••k up! America is not the best country in the world**</span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- It f•••••g annoys me see more and idiots waving the American flag or boasting about being American. Its not as great as you think, but you wouldn't know that because you've never traveled you piece of s••t. 
</span>

15. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'> **Why are stupid people the ones that have never traveled?** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- </span>

16. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Dont learn about another planet when you barely know about yours, it's ridiculous!** </span>
<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- </span>

17. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Don't ask me where I'm from, if you don't know your geography. It's f•••••g rude! **</span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- </span>

18. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**What Snowden did was right, but you wouldn't understand that you piece of s••t!** </span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- This came from an argument that my d4d brought up, but I don't f•••••g understand why you would want to bring an argument, if you don't care to listen to the other side. I simply ended the argument by saying that Christianity is one of the most dominant religions in the world right now, but keep in mind its the same religion that was used to enslave black people. How could someone who  preaches the gospel do all these evil deeds? It doesn't end there, look back at history and you'll see all the crazy things people deem while proclaiming the lords name. I don't see why there is to need to argue when the federal appeals court ruled that the NSA’s bulk collection of phone metadata was illegal and unnecessary. When I see snowden, I see a man who was persecuted for professing his faith to the world. A man who risked everything to tell the truth in the face of a corrupt government </span>

19. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**As a scribe it is imperative  that you write your own story.** </span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- Don't let someone else write your story for you, unless you hired them. Don't let someone else write your story unless, you are being paid and the style of the content is an interview. The reason I avoid publicity is because people take things out of context and write about it to defame your name. Critics don't leave legacies, but they do damage ones reputation. 
</span>

20. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Its stupid to rely on donations as your primary source of income!** </span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- The first people I think of is those open source developers, people with a patreon account or something equivalent. I would even go as far as to say that donations fall under the liabilities on the cashflow quadrant. With church its different, I can understand an only fans side hustle, but the latter not so much.
</span>

21. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**People who throw  liquids in trash bags are c•••s!**</span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-
</span>

22. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Disney make people f•••••g g4y** </span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-  </span>

23. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Naruto is f•••••g g4y and depressing, why the f••k would you watch that?** </span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- I dropped that s••t as soon as I could because I am not watching anime to feed on depression and queer vibes. I am watching anime to escape reality. I never got to shippuden, let alone finish the first 10 episodes, man f••k shippuden and f••k boruto too. </span>

24. <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why the f••k do mobile service providers sell numbers?** </span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- Sim swapping is an attack were the user of a phone number is revoked access and the number is transfered to another user (attacker). What's even more dangerous is the fact that if you don't pay for your phone service  the provider will sell that number to someone else. That is super dangerous and I'm shocked. If you use your phone number for OTP authentication, have contacts. Phone numbers are dangerous
</span>

24.  <span style='color:#ffbf00;'>**Why the f••k is every manhua about cultivation?**</span> <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- does it have to do with censorship? Are Chinese people not creative? Are manhuas a global propaganda to spread Buddhism passively? Are manhuas exclusively targeted towards Chinese people? The moment you see the words Qi, cultivation, foundation or some estoteric s••t about the heavens. The character are too obvious they will either include an x, z, l g s, h, g

</span>

25. **How the f••k do people still not know about ad blockers?** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>

26. **Upgrade your business type instead of relying on ads and telling people to stop using an ad blocker!** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- I clicked on your website because I wanted information out of it or to use it. I didn't click your website so that I can click on ads.
</span>

27. **Manhwa is better than manga you p•••k!** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>

28. **I avoid getting into heated debates because I don't want to use Neuro Linguistic Programming!** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
- I've made enemies and I've made people cry because of my argumentative skills.

</span>

29. **American cartoons are the definition of child p0rn!** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>

30. **Why the f••k do movies add romance, it f•••••n ruins the story?** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>
31. Why the f••k are TV shows so f•••••g long? <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>
32. **College is where kids go to get brainwashed and become high tax payers!**<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>

33. I moved out because you f•••••g talk too much you c••t!<span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

</span>

34. **You're whi73 stop complaining and get your s••t together your privileged c•••••r!** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-
</span>

35. **Why the f••k would you make your friends pay full price when you possess the ability to give them a discount?** <span style='color:#ff465d;'>
-

36. **The word young is not synonymous with immortality!**
- I hate it when people say you can eat whatever you want you don't have to picky because you're young and to that I say F••k that! Just because I am young doesn't mean I am not human. Take care of your body when you are young not when you are older. That S••t carries through, I decide to eat heathy now and I know that carries, even I have high metabolism. 

37. **Drowning in the 21st century is stupid!**
- With all the advancements that humanity has done in aquatics, it doesn't make sense to drown. Why are you drowning, just paddle? You should stay away from water in the first place that way you don't drown because humans were meant to live on the ground.

38. F••k JavaScript!
- Really? Its everywhere! JavaScript supremacy is injustice

39. Phones with notches are F•••••g stupid!
- that's not aesthetic, that's rubbish. Your monitor and TV don't have notch, why should your phone have it?

40. Disney stole Masala!
- To my surprise Bollywood is bigger than Hollywood and one interesting fact about the musical style movies started out in India in the 1960s. A style common referred to as Masala and to my dismay Disney stole that. I felt the need to rant because its not mentioned online and that S••t is heartbreaking. Stealing something only to make it worse, F•••••g peasants.
