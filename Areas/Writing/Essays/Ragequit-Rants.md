1. **Why do logical people consume diuretics?**
- Coffee, beer, wine, tea

2. **Eating out in restaurants is overrated!**
- It's cheaper and better to cook the food yourself
Why pay more for a one time meal, as opposed to buying ingredients that will last you for weeks, even months.

3. **Why do people have children when they can barely afford to keep themselves alive?**
- The amount of children in orphanages just pains my heart and eyes
Asians have the right plan. The population decline of  south Korea, japan and other countries seems reasonable. The housing cost is high, it's quadruple just by having kids.

4. **Why do people still use windows?**
- I moved on something better and I can say that

5. **I would rather own my software than be a slave to the cloud, internet or sass!**
-

6. **Why do people still use resumes?**
Only idiots are unaware of applicant tracking systems
-

7. **Your company shouldn't have a mission statement if you pay a shitty wage**
-

8. **Working in America fucking sucks.** The same job you are able to make a living off off, but you need to have w fucking second just to get by. Thats why people live paycheck to paycheck
-

9. **You simply can't understand. You wouldnt care about something unless you know someone close to you who has gone through that situation**
- I care about brain health because I know someone who was close to me. If only he had gotten the help he wouldn't have taken his own life. Its the same with you wouldn't care much about cancer even  though you see people people wear shirts, participate in walks or other activities, unless you know someone very close to you who has that illness. 

10.  **Why the fuck do we let big tech control our personal lives?**
- I fucking hate Facebook, they own Instagram and WhatsApp. They were better separate, but now it's a fucking mess. They won't even let you use Instagram as a full fledged desktop app to upload shit.



11.  **Why the fuck do comic artists make their flashbacks so fucking long?**
- I am totally fine with 3 to 5 chapters of flashbacks or occasionally tossing in a small flashback snippet, but I absolutely hate when a flashback is like 50 chapters. It makes me so mad, its like why didn't you just slowly build the story instead of waiting to fucking halt the progress. I stopped watching anime because I got so bored of all those character monologues, fan service ,the feeling you get after completion (now what?), and, worst of them all fillers. I stopped reading manga not because its black and white, but because I couldn't find any high quality works similar to Boichi. I was caught up to everything I was reading, I ran out of recommendations I was starting to discover stuff on own and probably because I fell in love with manhwa. _Finally some color_ I exhaled.

12. **I'm not a minority, I'm a human being. What the hell is wrong with you?**
- Fuck America

13. **Why the fuck does the government want to control block chain technology?**
- Governments all around the world especially the USA already suppress people as it, why the fuck do they want to suppress innovation as well?

14. **Shut the fuck up! America is not the best country in the world**
- It fucking annoys me see more and idiots waving the American flag or boasting about being American. Its not as great as you think, but you wouldn't know that because you've never traveled you piece of shit. 

15. **Why are stupid people the ones that have never traveled?**
-

16. **Dont let about another planet when you barely know about yours, it's ridiculous!**
-

17. **Don't ask me where I'm from, if you don't know you're geography. It's fucking rude!**
-

18. **What Snowden did was right, but you wouldn't understand that you piece of shit!**
- This came from an argument that my father brought up, but I don't fucking understand why you would want to bring an argument, if you don't care to listen to the other side. I simply ended the argument by saying that Christianity is one of the most dominant religions in the world right now, but keep in mind its the same religion that was used to enslave black people. How could someone who  preaches the gospel do all these evil deeds? It doesn't end there, look back at history and you'll see all the crazy things people deem while proclaiming the lords name. I don't see why there is to need to argue when the federal appeals court ruled that the NSAâ€™s bulk collection of phone metadata was illegal and unnecessary. When I see snowden, I see a man who was persecuted for professing his faith to the world. A man who risked everything to tell the truth in the face of a corrupt government
