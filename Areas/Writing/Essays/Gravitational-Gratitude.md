Hello, first of all, I wanted to say thank you. I just realized the one thing that I lacked in my life was not empathy, but gratitude. Over the past few weeks, I started listening to a particular podcast called career crashers and reading their blog at crash.co/blog. I was listening to one particular podcast episode and the message made me reflect in the moment. One of the messages In the episode was don't undersell your previous life experiences that you have had in life. This is where I fell short, as someone who has immersed myself in various experiences, I never felt grateful about those moments, they were simply things that I did and long gone like a short term memory. I am deeply thankful for all the photographic memories that you have captured.  I was recently talking to one of my friends in Malawi and she shared some pictures. She asked me to send some pictures, but they were nowhere to be seen


. I know you asked me to send you a resume, but the truth is I don't believe a resume will get me a job. I have found something better, something that conveys who I truly am as a human being, not a piece of paper. Resumes used to work, but the one thing I can't deny is that things have changed. If I am stuck in the past thinking that old methods will work in the future, I am doing myself a disservice. I have found something that creates a signal that is too good to deny. I realized that I completed the course, but I haven't built anything that indicates my ability to solve something. I am stuck in the tutorial mindset, I can't think outside the box or try to fix a problem. I have been fixated on the idea of money and forgotten that coding is all about problem solving. It will definitely take time to do that. In the mean time, here is my current plan. I will pitch to companies in regards to still getting into the tech industry, especially startups. I am not putting coding on hold, I will still work on that. I this point, I realize that I just need to get my foot in the door like you said. That's my plan for this month. I can't guarantee or promise, but I am certain that I will be able to make the leap this month, March. My skills are at the point they need to be, but I will still do something in the industry that I am planning to get into. I am thankful that you are open minded and I hope that you will be understanding. 


Reasons
Death of my uncle
Tired of my porn addiction
Listening to crash career stories 
Job hopping and working at yet another low paying job
Hating my life because I haven't been growing at all(depression and post traumatic growth). I have been doing the opposite dying, dying before even reaching the age of 40.
Acne and lack of confidence
Started talking to people and not keeping things to myself
Found someone who shares the same ideas as me regarding education, Lin Kaira
Lacks of funds to fund my trip
Have to be strong for my family in Malawi, especially my sister and cousin Ludo.

At age 21, I fully adopted the crash mindset, worked on building a second brain since, found out that I lacked something very crucial - gratitude, learned out loud, reset my brain revisiting Malawi, learned latin
