I need the power of now more than ever. I am at the crossroads of indecision and have realized just how books alone wont solve the bigger issue, money. Money is something i dont touch upon because it comes and goes. The shocking reality came in when i realized i wonâ€™t be able to make enough money to move out of my Parents house. I have hopes for a brighter future, but i am starting to realize or get the hint that its hopeless to make some change even with perfect planning. My plan A wont be enough because the truth is that simply making $9000 dollars wont be enough to fund for the minimalist lifestyle that i am hoping for. I must resort to plan B. plan B is something i wanted to avoid at all costs because it has the greatest health risk, but high reward. Before i dive into plan B lets first revise or look at plan A. Plan A simply has one major flaw.

Plan A

Username: Prince Namwali

Sleep: 6 to 8 hours of sleep

Work hours: 40 or less = $340 x End of January 2010 = $9,000

Savings = Initially $4000 saving towards bootcamp = $12,000 (was possible, but gratification and ego got in the way)

Bootcamp plan: Fail (not enough funds)

College transfer: 2020 (no scholarship, $160,000 in debt, no portfolio)

Move out implementation: Pixelbook, Surface Pro 6, Pixel Slate, Oculus Quest, Vive Pro, 6 Developer Station Devices, PS VR (Not enough funds)

Overall plan. Stick to the BRIGHTMINDS Program, Work full time

Narrative: Plan A is optimised towards health and using Kaizen to achieve everything. The user is focused on becoming well rounded and being average at everything in order to fulfill his immortality project. He never fully dives into a project because he takes small steps and stops when the challenge is difficult. The user only does things when he is in the mood. He has nasty habits, very antisocial despite possessing a communication device. Is very introverted and does not speak up. The user is fear driven, a cheat, a lier, a self entitled hypocrite. He believes the future will become better with minimal effort. The user is brainwashed and does not realize that the times are changing. He believes that if he just purchases or consumes the next thing his life will change. He is continuously feeding his ego, creating a multitude of noises in his mind and is quite ignorant.

Plan B

Username: Kaizen Oasis

Sleep: Fixed 4 hours except sunday= 8

Work Hours: Same =40 (No second job required)

Savings: Build towards moving out (Apartment, food and everything else thats not pre-available in the move out collection) - Open another bank account strictly for savings

Bootcamp: No need (Udemy, Youtube and the internet will do)

College Transfer: To hell with it,i am not signing up for slavery, i can learn from real teachers.

Move out Implementation: Everything can be attained

Pixelbook, Pixel Slate, Tab S4, Surface Pro 6, Oculus Quest, Lenovo Mirage Solo, Vive Pro

XPS 13,

Overall Plan: This user is strictly focused on building a cult like following and creating lots of content for multiple platforms. This user will achieve mastery in everything without being average or mediocre. Kaizen Oasis is like a gift from the gods. He might die trying to achieve this large task, but if that happens so be it. This user is focused on hoarding money in whatever way that he can. The purpose for this is to buy as many gadgets as possible and test them in person before he can make the choice on which ones to keep when it comes to moving out.I realize that this is in fact selfish, but the truth is that with the rest of crew making its appearance next year, they shall experience or inherit such great devices as their own. If my stuff breaks i will simply replace them with new stuff when i get my own apartment.
