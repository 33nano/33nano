The idea came to me one night after work when i went on Github in order to start forking some of my favorite repositories of android apps that i find intriguing. I remember searching for Muse headband and right after Coinomi. Then the idea came to me? What if you could use EEG headsets to earn cryptocurrency. The power of EGG headsets is amazing and i dont doubt it especially when i watched a YouTube Video called Beyond Sonification. The video is real and its crazy that EEG headsets have the power to read your mind and display what you are thinking. Science is reserved for crazy people after all. I decided that it would be one my lifes mission to utilize EEG headsets and Cryptocurrency. But before i jumped into some more searching i first had to understand how money is made. You think money is printed, but that half true. What about the money thats not in circulation? The shocking reality is that money is software. People to learn programming in order to truly understand money and even how to make it. What would it take for every country in the world to replace its currency with a new one? They would have to print prototypes and have the government to make people believe that the paper has value. The second part is that printing can be a waste of paper, wouldnt it be able to just make it digital and skip the printing phase? If you skip the printing phase that makes money hardware you are esentially creating software? The real question is not how many printers the central banks of the world or the US Federal reserve has but how many servers, programmers and computers do they have? The biggest question is whats really in the central banks? People should not be worrying about whats in Area 51 or 52 because the answers are available.

Marketing is the process of getting someone to buy something they don't need in order to satisfy your greed
