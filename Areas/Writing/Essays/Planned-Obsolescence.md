Learned something new today, April 24,2021

The reason apple is the #1 tech in the world. 
1. Installing iOS updates that slow down your phone to force to switch to the newer version

Turns out the reason I abandoned Oneplus  and stopped being a fanboy is because Oneplus was no longer focused on creating flagship devices. They served that mission once and they became hypocrites of their own mantra because they did settle (their slogan/mantra is never settle). They reached the pinnacle of flagship devices only to start releasing incremental updates that weren't worth the upgrades. Oxygen OS used to be the best Android Experience, but I must sadly say that the only satisfactory Android experience comes from custom Roms. There is no stock Android flavor or skin that would ever match the sweet savory umami emitted from custom Roms, not even from Pixel devices.It sorta reminds me of the analogy of a tech startup using newer technologies or hybrid for that matter, Flutter being a good example. The company will be able to build for both Android & iOS and ship fast,but once they scale they will  abandon altogethwr and default to native solutions. They will hire Android engineers and iOS engineers because stock beats hybrid and that point it wouldn't matter because they can do more. Kotlin/Java and Swift/Objective-C for mass gains.
The last Oneplus device I owned was the 7 Pro. The spec king was now overthrown by a God, gaming phones... more specifically Asus ROG Phone 3.
