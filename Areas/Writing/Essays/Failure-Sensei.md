> Failure doesn't exist. If it doesnt work today try again in a few minutes, hours or the next day because you will eventually get it. 


List
1. Android customization (bootloop, brick,root)
2. Abandoning windows and apples in favor of Linux (mistakes i ran into, lightdm , look up some)
3. Roller skates learning (watch , imitate don't fall)
4. Swimming learning (no drown, just paddle)
5. Data breach (got into privacy, have I been pawned site)
6. Search engine optimization (you don't need an alias if you have a unique name to begin and avoid medium)
7. $80 salmon, aye was that there earlier, per pound (lasted a month, so win win)
8. 
Kobe Bryant said in an interview that failure doesnt exist...

In this essay i would like to look at some of my own examples throughout my life. I ran into a few setbacks which i was able to overcome or overturn

### Android Customization
> I used to fear that i would mess up my phone, by trying to root or install a custom rom

I feared rooting my android phone because of the thought or rather a visualization that i would mess up my phone and force to buy a new one...The benefits of bloking ads and customizing my phone even further outwayed that fear of failure. I have bricked my phone before, hard brick and soft brick, but i have recovered. At this point, i dont even watch videos on how to root and flash a custom ROM. i go straight to the XDA forums and just read through it. If i mess up, i try again, until it works.

Now i joyfully rejoice in tasker scripting, applying elegance with substratum themes, blocking ads with Adaway, flashing custom kernels, flashing custom ROMS

### Switching From Windows
> I used to think windows and macos where the only options

I feared switching to this thing called Linux/unix because i thought i would mess my computer....

Now i rejoice in arch based distros, especilly Artix. I find catharsis in ricing my operating system from the terminal, window manager, i find myself a member of the church of neovim

### Roller Skates
> This is difficult, i will never be able to learn this

I feared that i would never be able to enjoy this leisurely activity of dragging my feet...

Now i rollerblade, which turns out to be much healthier than running






You can learn without making mistakes <!-- Dad always talked about, but the advise came as a reflection of his own life. A young man infatuated by money thinking that receiving credit card junk mail was his calling, pampered by the status of having expensive cars when he was clearly unaware that wealth is a mindset, not a purchase. -->
You can learn swimming without drowning
Condom usage without stds or paying child support

The one thing that i can draw from all this is that i prioritized growth over the outcome


### Job Hunt Failure

Breaking away from learned helplessness was a struggle, i was consumed and floating in the deep depths of fear. I was tirelessly applying for a jobs like the trained communist that i am from all those years of learning communism in school. Filling out html forms that required boolean responses, odd questions and absurd requirements. Only to be filtered out by an applicant tracking system, an entity that is not human. Only be greeted 2 weeks later or 2 months later with an automated responses that used the same language pattern, Unfortunately we have decided... Feeling hopeless and being underpaid by the plutonomic system that i find myself in, i decided enough was enough. Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over expecting things to be different. Only fools believe that a paper can capture their personality and talents. Only fools believe that a paper is signal that shall award them the life of their dreams. 


### The Overpriced Neurochemical, Omega 3
20 year old Prince decided that he wanted to start eating healthy. He was reading a whole bunch of stuff including neuroscience medical journals. Hmm hmm omega 3 fatty acids, great for the Brain, memory boost. Side note medical journals are not that hard to read, especially if you know Latin. I was sold on the idea of fish and the only thing I could think of was Salmon. I went to the fish market which is a 15 minute drive from home and I had my sight set on purchasing salmon. I should mention that my visual acuity is 20/20 because its a key factor. The line wasn't long and there it was $9 salmon. I was like man that's a good deal, I'll tsje the whole thing. I went to the checkout line and I my total bill was $80. Wait that's not right. I looked at the price again and there was something after the 9 it said / lb. What the heck does that mean? The moment I realized it meant per pound it was too late. I was already to buying the fish, but deep down that price made my heart ache

### Burnt Offerings

I don't consider myself a chef, but I do enjoy cooking a couple of dishes. 

Today April 25, 2021, I failed yet again. I tempted to cook orange chicken. I had purchased all the necessary ingredients the day before and today I just bought the key ingredient, chicken ( chicken thighs). I watched the video that popped up on YouTube and that was by the channel Smokin & Grillin with AB. I loved the video due to the fact that it was separated into 2 parts. The first involved frying the chicken once mixing the key ingredients: salt, pepper, 1 egg and cornstarch. The challenge or that what I failed at was the final portion, the reason for the name, the orange sauce. The first time I ran through it I simply winged it. I had no clue of the specific measurements that went into the concoction of the sauce. The first time it was missing the lemon zest or rather I ommited that because I thought it was optional. I failed because I thought I could wing it. The second time was a failure because the lemon zest overpowered all the other ingredients and the corn starch slurry mix was unequivocally mixed. Was I ashamed or furious? I don't exactly know  because no one got to taste the fruits of my failure and it was my money that I used to buy the ingredients in the first place. I broke one of my rules, if you plan on cooking a new dish by all means don't use the recommended size portions. Go small, don't go big. Small mistakes are better than big mistakes which end up being a waste of time, money and food. Even worse was that I opened the fridge in order to ingest the mistake that I had created only to be shocked by the stench of a failed creation that ended up in the trash can. Someone threw it, but I don't know who. Maybe it would have been nice if someone had the premade sauce ready for cooking/mixing with precooked chicken. Was than an excuse to make me feel better about my failure? Maybe. Whose fault is it when you follow a recipe religiously only to fail at cooking that which you desire?@

1. If cooking something new, go small
2. If you fail multiple times abandon it, you can always find new and healthier recipes

Is healthier food easier to cook than unhealthy food?
- I assume you asked this question because orange chicken involves sugar and oil in the same mixture. I would arguably say its true, I mean its not like orange chicken is a healthy dish to Begin with, heck chicken is bad for you, you should stick to fish. Matelote (fish cooked with wine) or orange fish, if such a thing exists (orange chicken logic/ dish applied to fish)

Is fish the only source of omega 3?

With all your cooking failures, why not just become a vegan, vegetarian or pescatarian?

Does society consider you a failure if you abandon cooking for the sake of a dietary lifestyle like a vegan?
