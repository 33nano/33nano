> Failure doesn't exist. If it doesnt work today try again in a few minutes, hours or the next day because you will eventually get it. 

Kobe Bryant said in an interview that failure doesnt exist...

In this essay i would like to look at some of my own examples throughout my life. I ran into a few setbacks which i was able to overcome or overturn

### Android Customization
> I used to fear that i would mess up my phone, by trying to root or install a custom rom

I feared rooting my android phone because of the thought or rather a visualization that i would mess up my phone and force to buy a new one...The benefits of bloking ads and customizing my phone even further outwayed that fear of failure. I have bricked my phone before, hard brick and soft brick, but i have recovered. At this point, i dont even watch videos on how to root and flash a custom ROM. i go straight to the XDA forums and just read through it. If i mess up, i try again, until it works.

Now i joyfully rejoice in tasker scripting, applying elegance with substratum themes, blocking ads with Adaway, flashing custom kernels, flashing custom ROMS

### Switching From Windows
> I used to think windows and macos where the only options

I feared switching to this thing called Linux/unix because i thought i would mess my computer....

Now i rejoice in arch based distros, especilly Artix. I find catharsis in ricing my operating system from the terminal, window manager, i find myself a member of the church of neovim

### Roller Skates
> This is difficult, i will never be able to learn this

I feared that i would never be able to enjoy this leisurely activity of dragging my feet...

Now i rollerblade, which turns out to be much healthier than running






You can learn without making mistakes 
You can learn swimming without drowning
Condom usage without stds or paying child support

The one thing that i can draw from all this is that i prioritized growth over the outcome
