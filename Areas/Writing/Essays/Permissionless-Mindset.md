You know what sucks about having a job?
Your time is not your known even if you show them your availability. Companies will force you to stay late or work extra hours, even if they hate people going overtime. A fixed hourly rate is the root of al injustice. No matter how busy it gets, especially those days when you just feel like walking out and saying goodbye,  but you can't because you have adult responsibilities weighing you down. Companies that make you stay until close and won't let you go home unless they give you their expressively explicit verbal permission.
