# System Hack

No matter how perfect you think a system is people always find ways to circumvent, drift off or hack the system. This essay takes a look at modern examples in modern day life and a few of my own.

### The List
1. Soundtrap
2. AIVA
3. Burner phones
4. Fake Emails
5. VPN
6. Adblock

Sound trap
You get 3 months of free premium just by passing the sound trap academy course (just the tests, the rest is useless)
Here are the answers:


Aiva
An AI powered music generator. A free account is given the power to download 3 songs a month. With multiple faje emails, the number 3 becomes unlimited. 100 emails= 300 songs, 10 emails = 30 songs.
They don't have a way to patch it, nor do they do any IP address limiting, even if they did its easy to circumvent using a VPN. If they went a step further and limited the MAC Address, that can also be spoofed, all in the name of borrowed creativity.
