What do I need that the currently available options dont provide or lack? What if? How come? Why? Is this the only way? Is there a better solution? How can we make it better? How can we change this?

Necessity is why we search for stuff on the internet. You search for information on the internet because you need something. That something could be informative or entertaining. What you are looking for might come in the form of text, audio, picture or a video. 


Necessity is brought out of frustration, longing for something better,  a new and improved solution, or a remix of the existing.




Great examples, praxis , crash co, gcam mod, custom Roms, magisk

Use most historic examples and tie it together with the present, especially start with why

Some of the questions will be better off in the rants

I had a vague idea of what this quote meant, but now I have the full image. Truth be told necessity begins with a question.

During the horse and buggy days, the question was asked and the need was required
The problem is that the current mode of transportation is slow. We need something better. How can we do that? Is it possible?

The top  tech company in the world, google, said that all the languages out there are unable to meet our needs, what was born? A new language called go. A language born from frustration

I realize that the reason I have been unable to make progress is because I have not been asking myself question or rather my answers are dull. I have come to realize that the reason i was able to grow and acquire so much knowledge is because of the questions that I asked myself during high school. At that time i had inflammatory questions, questions that i was curious about. Questions of which i knew the education system till this day has no answers to. Questions of which i later found by reading books, searching the internet. Question's like is college the only way? Why do people struggle with money? How can I learn faster? How can I apply what I learn? How can I improve my brain health? Is it possible to great things without sacrificing your health and sleep? All of which i have come to find answers through great teachers living and dead. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Kwik Brain podcast, Mindmap mastery by tony buzan,  Why do I want to learn programming because it's cool and makes a lot of money. Truth be told what i am actually seeking is the business side or business in the general sense. Not necessarily coding. 

Until I have multiple questions on my mind or problems that I feel need to be solved , I won't be able to make progress. It's like learning just for the sake of learning, instead of learning to do something or fix something.

1. **Why learn latin?** 
- To stop using an English dictionary. I will be able to improve my English and easily learn romance languages, especially spanish which I stopped since high school.

2. **Why dont I consumer  sugar?**
- Inflammation. I hate it. 

3. **Why did God invent black people?**
-

4. **Is God racist?**

-

6. **Is it possible for logical reasoning to overpower h0rnin3ss?**
- 

7. **Is there any reason to avoid trying new food?**

-

10. **If you can't survive in the usa what makes you think you can survive outside?**
-

11. **Why can't you stop consuming ####?**
- Fantasy is greater than reality. The amount of voluptuous eye candy available on the surface web is simply more convenient than the process it takes to get to know another homo-sapien. 

12. **Writing vs meditation?**
- Writing is effective because you can see and feel the effects in real time.Whereas meditation takes more time to achieve the same effect and meditation is environment dependent. A noisy environment is the enemy of meditation - just think about it there is a reason monks meditate in the mountains or secluded places from society. Meditating with noise canceling headphones won't exactly do anyone justice because you don't want the weight of your wearables to outweigh your thoughts

13. **What problems does game development solve?**
- Think about it, I mean its the same reason why most indie game devs haven't made it yet.They are simply making games because it's fun, cool, nostalgic , but they haven't  thought critically. Anyone can make a game, heck the easiest game type of game to make is a visual novel. But what problems does a visual novel solve? Is entertainment even considered a problem? What good does entertainment serve when there are real problems in the world that need to be addressed. 

14. **How can you meditate when you are stuck in a maladaptive daydreaming trance?**
-

15. **Is there an off switch to maladaptive daydreaming?**

- That's how life is, but is it really?

21. **How do I sync markor with Obsidian?**
-

22. **Whats the workaround for getting VST's to work on Reaper without relying on Manjaro?**
- Ever since I installed another arch based distro, but the one which requires the user to setup everything I can't seem to get most of my VST's especially Vital (spent $80) to work


23. **Does a CC0 license require attribution?**

2. **Go**
> A new programming language born at Google
- Google,one of the top tech companies in the world,ran into a problem. The team at Google said, "None of the programming language's out there are meeting our needs, we need something else, we need something better." The bigger problem was the fact that the solution was nowhere in sight.  Frustration filled the atmosphere and the need for a better solution was dire. Google hired some of the luminaries in computer science and got to work. Necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question. Starting with why should be at the core, without it your possibilities never amount to more. How can we fix it? How about a new programming language? Boom! The creative juices started flowing, brainstormed ideas evaporated and submerged into existence

<!-- Prince Kaizen Namwali -->

1. **is it possible to make a music video using a game engine?**
- Stormzy rainfall. Creating videos is inevitable. Video marketing attracts a larger audience and will land you some great deals and partnerships that you never thought were possible. 

2. **Is it possible to make animation using free and open source software, without doing it  frame by frame?**
- Throughout my searching I can't seem to find any animation tool that meets my needs on Linux. Synfig is awesome, but the rendering takes super long and the animations end up janky. The only solution which is not ideal, but gets the job done with more steps using animation tools that are built for game development. Blender is a great solution, if you have high end hardware and all the time in the world.

3. **Is it possible to create visually pleasing videos without a green screen?**
-

4. **Is it possible to mix and master music well without Avid Pro Tools?**
- Learning to mix and master using your favorite Digital audio workstation of choice takes time. It doesn't and won't happen overnight. Stop thinking that you can't do something because you don't have certain software or tools. People out there have done it and continue to do it, with open source software at that. Look at Unfa he only uses Ardour. Starting out you may be skeptical, but with time everything gets better. You will easily find your workflow and never have to worry again. You could go a step further and use scripting to enhance your workflow, if you feel that your saves presets aren't quite enough. 

5. **How can I automate the process of clearing metadata from my Android phone without having to do it manually?**
- You would need access to the DCIM folder. Scripting is only possible through Tasker. You would need to write a script that requires overlay permissions in order to interact with an app that's specifically designed to clear metadata. The challenge 

6. **How can I render using a webserver with Synfig instead of relying on the local machine resources?**
- Its time consuming to render animations with Synfig. I believe the only thing that's truly holding this software back is the the rendering engine, it's super slow. Moho Studio Pro, a proprietary animation tool available on proprietary operating systems renders much faster for the same stuff, using the same hardware too.

7. **How can I make T-UI launcher complete?**
- I love termux, but I believe it could be skipped or become unnecessary if T-UI launcher was complete. What T-UI launcher lacks, at least from my perspective is: custom commands (neofetch, Hugo), changing shell type (zsh, bash, fish)

8. **Is maladaptive daydreaming stress induced?**
-

9. **What problems does television solve?**
- None. Its a tool use to brainwash, I mean neocolonize people. 


10. **How can we stop or prevent mass shootings?**
- I proposed a radiacal idea in a publication that i published online entitled, Billion Dollar App Ideas. One of the ideas I proposed was a gun mapper, an applications that enables people with the app to track guns in real time. The problem that I felt arose with mass shootings, road rage shootings or any type of shootings for that matter was one of gun awareness. The victims were unaware that someone was wielding a gun. I like to draw the analogy that's not too far fetched from reality, but an example from the world wars. Knowing everything about your enemy in advance allows for a great counterattack or defense. The Japanese were unaware that the USA possessed nuclear technology which led to a crushing defeat. If they had known, or had they the technology, they would have been the ones writing history. However, the bigger problem is how exactly do you go about doing that? How can a simple app have the ability of tracking the specific metallic composition of guns? What factors are necessary to apply that to ghost guns? Isn't gun tracking the same as surveillance? Is there such a thing as gun privacy? Should AI or algorithms be used to biased classify who can and cannot have a gun regardless if they are a current gun owner or of their living situation?

11. **What are the dangers of revisionist history?**
- Japanese people use manji symbol as an emoji. African Americans using the N-word (repeating history). White people were the only righteous demographic during history, everyone else was evil. 

12. **How can people keep up with TV shows or anything TV related without actually watching television?**
- The first thing that popped into my mind was the same technology behind RSS (RSS readers). Its either that or developing an algorithm that becomes your second eyes. Vidangel is an awesome service that enables you to filter the scenes you don't want to watch in movies or series, but what if, you could skip watching all together? Welcome, Sum Sum TV, an app that can summarize content for you. Never binge watch again or waste hours of your life trying to catch up to some social trend. 

13. **Is necessity the mother of invention or is it the doubting Thomas in us?**
-

14. **Is it possible to download YouTube subtitles without ever having to watch the video associated with it?**
-

15. **Why is text better than a video or podcast?**
- Searchable. How long does it take to figure out what's in a 1 hour video or 1 hour podcast? - 1 hour. Where as text allows you to easily search for keywords
- Speed reading and easier for mind mapping
- Text is timeless, why would someone want to watch a black and white movie from the past? Probably because they're white and racist
- Allows you to convey exactly what you are thinking, whereas in video it would be difficult to do so otherwise.

16. **Is it possible to write a book on Android?**
- I believe there is a way, but I haven't found the answer to it yet. If pandoc works then its possible.

17. **Is it possible to search for keywords in an entire eBook, without having to be on a specific page?**
- I am not sure if its really possible to do a global search, but I would interested. Its the next level of speed reading.

18. **What would it take to build a global comic database?**
- Good reads is great when it comes to books, but it's limitation lies in its bias for unpopular books and books of other languages (not in English)
- MyAnime list is great, but its only limited to manga and anime, no manhua or manhwa.
- Kitsu & Anilist are great options, despite Anilist being ahead, but the problem that encountered with these platforms is the fact that they use the Myanime list API for exporting. You can't export your mnahwa and manhua list. Its unfair, I believe thats exportation bias. 
- The proposal isn't to include western comics because those suck, but to have the greatness of Anilist, but  with the ability to export manhua and manhwa.

19. **Is it possible to fix the details tag not working in Obsidian?**
- The biggest pet peeve I have with Obsidian is the fact that the details tag doesn't work and because of that I am forced to scroll to see all my content. I hate scrolling , unless its a manhwa. I don't like reading markdown the same way that I read my manhwa. 

20. **Is cloud mining and hardware mining the only way to mine cryptocurrency?**
@- I proposed a radical idea in an online publication entitled, Billion Dollar App Ideas. In that publication one of the crazy ideas was mining through the act of autoeroticism. Auto3roticism with the aid of s3x toys, but more specifically smart s3x toys. 

21. **Is there a steganography app for mobile?**
- Steganography is a method of cryptography that involves encrypting information in ordinary files, but more specifically, images. Throughout my searching I have not found any application that does this. It would be great, if it existed and it would be even better if you use gifs as well. Gifs or images with memes are probably harmless and to the naked eye, look ordinary.

22. **Is there an offline mobile app for programming language documentation?**
- A dog is a mans best friend,  but documentation is a developers best friend. Having offline documentation is a surplus and its possible on desktop, but its a challenge on mobile. Being able to read documentation on a mobile device would be great because that way you're always in the know.

23. **What does it take to make a music generator?**
- Wolfram tone generator is by far the best, but its not offline.
- I would love to make a reggae music generator, as a first project and then eventually branch out to my other favorite genres 

24. **What does no student left behind look look like?**
- I believe the answer could be found through networking, but I think a great solution comes from an online Publication I published called Billion Dollar App Ideas. One of the ideas I proposed was an application that enables you to share notes, quiz answers and test answers with peers. Its not cheating, its collaboration and the truth of the fact that academia isn't a place that facilitated learning, but kills imagination, growth through a metric system of excellent thats devoid of reality. 

25. **How can Christians experience the different flavors/ denominations without ever having to attend in person worship?**
- I proposed a radical idea in an online publication entitled Billion Dollar App Ideas. The idea was simply an application that enables you to virtually experience different services in one

26. **Is it possible to procedurally generate Gregorian chants in the same manner that music is done?**
- Music generators are not a thing of the past and are used 

27. **Is it possible to communicate through EEG headsets?**
- This video shows what's possible with EEG headsets and drawing from that lens I believe EEG devices can do much more than simply read the electric activity of brainwaves.

28. **What would it take to build a decentralized application that incentivizes people who watch television?**
- I love the concept of LBRY, but I think the idea could go even further. This very idea could transform the way we view TV because the brutally honest truth is that it's a waste of time. If you could get paid to Watch television even better. The idea of basic attention token and the incentivization model of LBRY applies across all smart TVs. 

29. **What would a virtual fitting room look like?**
- The answer is drawn from an online publication that I published entitled Billion Dollar App Ideas.When you go shopping at a clothing store, you have the added advantage of trying the clothes on in a fitting room. When shopping online you simply go by the pictures and start thinking to yourself, "I will definitely look cool,once I order these clothes." Mind visualization has its limits, but you dont have to visualize it.Meet, Clothe thyself, an application that enables you to create a hyperrealistic 3D model of yourself. This model can be used across various Ecommerce sites.Clothe thyself is cross platform app that utilizes the power of Extended Reality Technology (VR, AR, & MR). This would make a pretty dope Saas. 

30. **What does it take for a developing country to become a developed country?**
- Is is the style of government? In the words of (insert name), " its hard for a developing country to develop using democracy." First world countries were built by slaves,but it slavery the answer? Japan was built through neocolonialism, but is neocolonialism the answer? Some countries were built by immigrant's, is the exploitation of foreign labor (immigrants) the answer?

31. **Is it possible to use GDScript as a scripting language outside of the Godot Game Engine?**
- I believe this would open a new set of possibilities. Adding gamification elements to apps like Gimp, Inkscape, Aseprite and more.
