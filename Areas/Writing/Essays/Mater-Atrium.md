What do I need that the currently available options dont provide or lack? What if? How come? Why? Is this the only way? Is there a better solution? How can we make it better? How can we change this?

Necessity is why we search for stuff on the internet. You search for information on the internet because you need something. That something could be informative or entertaining. What you are looking for might come in the form of text, audio, picture or a video. 


Necessity is brought out of frustration, longing for something better,  a new and improved solution, or a remix of the existing.




Great examples, praxis , crash co, gcam mod, custom Roms, magisk

Use most historic examples and tie it together with the present, especially start with why

Some of the questions will be better off in the rants

I had a vague idea of what this quote meant, but now I have the full image. Truth be told necessity begins with a question.

During the horse and buggy days, the question was asked and the need was required
The problem is that the current mode of transportation is slow. We need something better. How can we do that? Is it possible?

The top  tech company in the world, google, said that all the languages out there are unable to meet our needs, what was born? A new language called go. A language born from frustration

I realize that the reason I have been unable to make progress is because I have not been asking myself question or rather my answers are dull. I have come to realize that the reason i was able to grow and acquire so much knowledge is because of the questions that I asked myself during high school. At that time i had inflammatory questions, questions that i was curious about. Questions of which i knew the education system till this day has no answers to. Questions of which i later found by reading books, searching the internet. Question's like is college the only way? Why do people struggle with money? How can I learn faster? How can I apply what I learn? How can I improve my brain health? Is it possible to great things without sacrificing your health and sleep? All of which i have come to find answers through great teachers living and dead. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Kwik Brain podcast, Mindmap mastery by tony buzan,  Why do I want to learn programming because it's cool and makes a lot of money. Truth be told what i am actually seeking is the business side or business in the general sense. Not necessarily coding. 

Until I have multiple questions on my mind or problems that I feel need to be solved , I won't be able to make progress. It's like learning just for the sake of learning, instead of learning to do something or fix something.

2. **Why dont I consumer  sugar?**
- Inflammation. I hate it. 

3. **Why did God invent black people?**

10. **If you can't survive in the usa what makes you think you can survive outside?**
-

11. **Why can't you stop consuming porn?**
-

12. **Writing vs meditation?**
- Writing is effective because you can see and feel the effects in real time.Whereas meditation takes more time to achieve the same effect and meditation is environment dependent. A noisy environment is the enemy of meditation - just think about it there is a reason monks meditate in the mountains or secluded places from society. Meditating with noise canceling headphones won't exactly do anyone justice because you don't want the weight of your wearables to outweigh your thoughts

13. **What problems does game development solve?**
- Think about it, I mean its the same reason why most indie game devs haven't made it yet.They are simply making games because it's fun, cool, nostalgic , but they haven't  thought critically. Anyone can make a game, heck the easiest game type of game to make is a visual novel. But what problems does a visual novel solve? Is entertainment even considered a problem? What good does entertainment serve when there are real problems in the world that need to be addressed.

19. **Is maladaptive daydreaming a brain state that can be measured with an EEG device?**
-

20. **Why do bills exist?**
-

21. **How do I sync markor with Obsidian?**
-

22. Whats the workaround for getting VST's to work on Reaper without relying on Manjaro?
- Ever since I installed another arch based distro, but the one which requires the user to setup everything I can't seem to get most of my VST's especially Vital (spent $80) to work

1. **is it possible to make a a music video using a game engine?**
- Stormzy rainfall

2. **Is it possible to make animation using free and open source software, without doing it  frame by frame?**
- Throughout my searching I can't seem to find any animation tool that meets my needs on Linux. Synfig is awesome, but the rendering takes super long and the animations end up janky. The only solution which is not ideal, but gets the job done with more steps using animation tools that are built for game development. 

3. **Is it possible to create visually pleasing videos without a green screen?**
-

4. **Is it possible to mix and master music well without Avid Pro Tools?**
- Learning to mix and master using your favorite Digital audio workstation of choice takes time. It doesn't and won't happen overnight. Stop thinking that you can't do something because you don't have certain software or tools. People out there have done it and continue to do it, with open source software at that. Look at Unfa he only uses Ardour. Starting out you may be skeptical, but with time everything gets better. You will easily find your workflow and never have to worry again. You could go a step further and use scripting to enhance your workflow, if you feel that your saves presets aren't quite enough. 

5. **How can I automate the process of clearing metadata from my Android phone without having to do it manually?**
- You would need access to the DCIM folder. Scripting is only possible through Tasker. You would need to write a script that requires overlay permissions in order to interact with an app that's specifically designed to clear metadata. The challenge 

6. **How can I render using a webserver with Synfig instead of relying on the local machine resources?**
- Its time consuming to render animations with Synfig. I believe the only thing that's truly holding this software back is the the rendering engine, it's super slow. Moho Studio Pro, a proprietary animation tool available on proprietary operating systems renders much faster for the same stuff, using the same hardware too.

7. **How can I make T-UI launcher complete?**
- I love termux, but I believe it could be skipped or become unnecessary if T-UI launcher was complete. What T-UI launcher lacks, at least from my perspective is: custom commands (neofetch, Hugo), changing shell type (zsh, bash, fish)

8. **Is maladaptive daydreaming stress induced?**
-

9. **What problems does television solve?**
- None. Its a tool use to brainwash, I mean neocolonize people. 


10. Does a CC0 license require attribution?
