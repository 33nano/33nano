## Why Do People Struggle With Money?

People struggle with money because they are not taught in school and don't take the time to read finance books. One of the reasons people dont take the time to read is because of the mentality that “life is not always about money.” Its a toxic mentality because if you are not living the quality of life that you want, its safe to say that you need to change that mentality. Instead, people choose to learn money the hard way through credit card debt/loans, marrying too early, having a child too early, being sick of being an employee and worst of all regret. Money is not taught in school because the government doesn't want you to learn. The government would rather have you waste an absurd amount of money on a broken system of education to become a hard working tax paying employees. If you went to school its your fault because no one forced you to and its your fault even if you did go to school to not educate yourself on the subject of money. When it comes to the subject of money there is a man who has amazing resources and answers. This man is famous for a number of books (Robert T Kiyosaki).

## Is College The Only Way?

No, Its Not. The most toxic mentality is thinking that college is the only way. College has become more expensive, outdated with work standards and obsolete. I thought I had found the answer when i read the quote “College is dead, you need experience.” This caught my attention, but then the pricing page hit me. $15,000 for a 6 month bootcamp that delivers and truly prepares you for the real world (Praxis). I did my more digging and found out something extraordinary. The Praxis program can be summarized and attained within 2 Books.

Options are theoretical, opportunity are actual. 
Self taught, apprenticeship (bootcamp), internship

Memory Rescue is the ultimate book for people who desire a better life both mentally and physically. However, of the book isn’t enough there are two powerful tools that can be used in conjunction.

## How Can I Learn Faster?

Will power cannot suffice, you need something more to arm and combat yourself in this fast-paced changing world. You need something more to prepare yourself for the information overload. The answer to this question can be found in the field of neuroscience. Neuroscience provides us with three different technologies that enable us to alter our brainwaves.

TDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation)

PBM (Photo Bio Modulation)

BWE (BrainWave Entrainment)

These wonderful technologies correspond with the 10-20 EEG Electrode Scalp Placement System.

BWE is a neuromodulation that modulates the A2 and A1 Region

TDCS and PBM are Neurostimulation technologies that stimulate different parts of the brain
