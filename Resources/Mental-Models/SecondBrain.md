## 10 Principles
1. Borrowed creativity
- don't start from scratch
2. Capture habit ( outsorce your ideas to your ideas to your devices, don't use brain to store ideas)
3. Idea recycling (reuse ideas)
4. Projects over categories (deadline)
5. Slow burn (not everything has to be hard - small simple steps - kaizen)
6. Start with abundance ( don't start from a blank canvas or blank page, gather up rich resources and distill that into whatever you are creating)
7. Intermediate packets ( don't try to do something in one go, break it down into tiny daily actionable packets, build over time, no matter how much time you have everyday)
8. You only know what you make ( Taking action is the best way to learn, you don't have to become an expert or known everything in order to do something)
9. Make it easier for your future self (It's easy to spring into action when you have well preserved treasure)
10. Always keep your ideas moving ( no need to be stuck, turn to something else and come back to it later. )


# Personalized Principles
1. Steal like an artist (remix)
2. Outsource to device (knowledge worker )
3. Kaizen (small simple steps + continuous)
4. 
# Keep your ideas moving
If you sleep on something or take a walk, take a shower. After a minutes or hours, your Brain just goes ding. The problem was working in the background.
The problem of multitasking is that you lose your progress. Thinking and working externally enables you to do many more simultaneous things and reaps the benefits of multitasking without any of the downsides. 

With a second brain, you can, you will and you must multitask because you are not limited. You cant multitask with your first brain, but you can multitask with your second brain.  Flow requires movement ( made me think of the blood flow in the BRIGHT MINDS acronym by Dr Daniel Amen). Just pivot and come back to it later, but make sure you have saved it to your second brain first. 

# Make things easier for your future self
Tiago forte draws the imagery of his remarkable observation after graduating college. Some of his friends parents would work more and more as time progressed, while others worked less and less as time progressed. 
Producing results with much less effort, easier lifestyle. 

The difference in this shift he points to the word leverage.  Day by day, it's either you are building some sort of leverage (power or influence). Over time it's gonna get more and more powerful. Idea leverage or intellectual leverage is one of the most crucial aside from financial leverage and other types if leverage. Knowledge base , things that you have learned from your personal experience, these are things that compound over time. It grows on itself, it interconnects like a catalyst. Making each days work a little bit easier for tomorrow's self. For next week's self or next months self. 

# You only know what you make

The best way to learn as making something. When you get your hands dirty. The defects in your understanding instantly come to light.
Intellectual entertainment - reading so many books thinking that you are growing when in reality, you can't recall anything you read from those books. What do I care about impressive stats or actually engaging at the deepest level of these ideas. 

# intermediate packets
The parts of your work. Most people generally don't think of their work as in parts, but like tasks or activities, block of time. 
Every piece of work no matter how large is built of parts, you start to think of time. What is just one part that I can  make for this thing that I am creating...?
Just create an outline for your email
Time by time it just builds up

It's hard to fail when you writing an outline
One brick at a time

# Borrowed Creativity
Creativity doesn't come from nothing, it comes from somewhere. All creativity is remixed or a remix (Steal like artist book comes to mind). 
Building a second brain, changes how you consume things (higher quality). 
In school they say " no cheating" , in school you arent allowed to borrow or copy someone elses work, everything had to be original, but the truth is that's impossible. 

In the professional world you borrow ideas and you try to gather the richest resources like a fully designed website.

# Capture Habit
Capture habit comes from the gtd methodology(getting things done, a book by david allen from 2001). It can be summarized to write it down. Whatever is it, write it down, write it down before you know that if it's good, write it down before you know it you're gonna use it, even if you are certain. You will never forget it for the rest of your life. You mind has a certain carrying capacity (working memory). 

The best example/ imagery is that of a person with groceries in their hands. As long they have groceries in their hands they can't cook a beautiful meal, or buy another item, until you unload those groceries. 

This capture habit truly speaks to me because I find it difficult to recall people's name and previous events in my life.

The brain is only concerned with survival, that's why it's essential to outsource your ideas to a computer for storing. Anything a computer can do we should outsource to them.

# Idea Recycling

It's very similar to borrowed creativity, except the key difference is that you are borrowing from yourself. Note taking is all about time travel. You can fully capture your state of mind. Intellectual assets - the things you create. 
Ideas only get better, ideas are not subject to entropy,not subject to the laws of physics. Ideas don't perish. 

Intellectual capital. Because you created it before, you should reuse it. It's your own template. 

# Projects over Categories

The problem with categories boils down to, the more notes you have the less valuable they become, which is what the second brain tries to combat. Completed projects can be archived, it's something you can check off. Projects are a great signifier of output as a knowledge worker. Goals are long term, ideas are ethereal (not concrete), projects are in the middle (finish line)(clear objective). Categories are consumption oriented and projects are production oriented. Categories are abstract, projects are linear and happen in time (specific). 

# Slow Burns

Collect things in the background. 
Something that you thought would be a one year project can be a 5 hour project because you have all the necessary resources and can easily connect them in that time (no stress). 

If you don't have any collected material, then you will stress out. 
A great example provided was that of a scavenger. 
Scavenging works when your environment is rich. You can't be a scavenger when there is not game or a drought. 

We live in a world of creative abundance, not scarcity. 

# Start With Abundance

Don't start from scarcity. You refuse to start something until all the resources are plentiful. 

I need to create my notes for this with practical examples because the podcast episode doesn't do a great job at explaining this principle
