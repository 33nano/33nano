**EP 1; Perfectionism and deadlines**

Doesnt like deadlines - goes against projects in PARA
A deadline gives you an excuse to take more time, but the reality of not having a deadline is that you can accomplish something faster

Perfectionism wont exist because of the artist dilemma and when you release on a consistent schedule it basically becomes useless because the reality of being human is that you wont push high quality results every time. 

**EP2: Community and Critique**

Takes his experience from running a discord server. Not everybody responds to constructive feedback the same. Dont give feedback unless someone explicitly implies they would like feedback. 

**EP3: What School doesnt teach you**

Bad audio quality. 

Anyways, long story short its  bunch of 3D creators in a collaborative interview provide their insights about the reality of work and why school is essentially useless


**EP4: Why Geniuses Fail**

The fear of failure itself happens to be one of the key factors.  They fail because they cant handle failure or feel like failure shouldnt exist. 

**EP5: Benefits of Procrastination**


Procrastination assists with originality and creative thinking - quote from a book

 Productive procrastination can help you with fewe projects and helps you learn better. The things you do when you are procrastination are things you should be doing. You cant procrastinate on something you love because it steals youur attention.  


**EP6: Blender Nest**

Builing blendernest for blender youtubers - a space for blender creators.

[Summary](https://www.blendernest.space/blog/a-change-of-pace)


**EP7: Blender with Charan**

Mechanical engineer using proprietary software switched to Blender. Solid Works is the industry standard for CAD Modelling. 
He has a channel known as Just 3D Things - another Blender channel just like Blender Guru.

Why cant Solidworks do this and Blender can do that?

  Just an example of someone who realized that proprietary software was a limitation to his work. He had to change his mindset to realize that they are other options. It might be scary to make the switch, but the benefits are huge 

**EP8: University and Job Security**

Is university worth it?

Certs are better than degrees. 
University is outdated  because its based on what the government wants you to learn. Government doesnt always have the best interest in keeping up with the industry standards and the ever growing landscape of technology. 

Build your own portfolio and market yourself because University wont do that for you. You can sell your Blender projects


**EP9: Animated Shorts and Dark History**

If you try to make everything yourself its going to take a long time and you will eventuallu get bored, its not gonna happen, Somethings will never get made. Using others people artwork will save time and your interest wont wane. 
Note: I think procedural generation makes so much sense, no wonder why he created procedurally generated content with the blender addon that he made.
