# Forward Tilt 

> A podcast by Praxis. If you want a great career, you're gonna have to create it. 
*I didn't count the first episode as one because it was more like a trailer. Episode are shifted by +1. Episode 6 is 7...*

## Episode 1: Get Shit Done!
A story of 2 interns. Great first impression, promised to do something, but didnt do it.
Second intern. Not a great first impresion, but got stuff done. 
- I remember saying i would write an article on DeFi for a tech startup that invited me to their Asana board, but i never did it. All impressions went out the roof. Thats just one occurence that i believe sort of resonates with this episode. 
- When you get stuff done you immediately set yourself up for greater opportunities. The people develop trust in you and are willing to go an extra mile to do something for you.

## Episode 2: As If Its True
> Whatever you're doing when your are procrastinating is what you should be doing all the time
- Sparked a debate."The best way to gain self knowledge is to pretend that its true, act as if its true."
What is the feeling that you are purposing? That feeling, maybe that's what i should be pursuing, not the activity itself? How can i get more of that feeling?
See what you can gain from it? What are the implications?

## Episode 3: The 3 Advantages of Low Income
> One of the greatest assets that young people have is a lack of high income
Story of a man who had a decent job that paid well. His peers pressured him to upgrade his lifestyle, so he bought a car, bought a house and upgraded other
toys in his life. He reached a point where he reliazed that he hated his job even though he had a mortage and a car note. Low opportunity cost when you have low income. You can experiment, you are not giving up much. Prove your value creation and move your way up to a higher earning. You have a lot of time to learn, flexibility, if it doesnt work out. Deliver above your cost. Free from lifestyle slavery. Its hard to go backwards in lifestyle. 

## Episode 4: The Power of Questions
Rather than chasing answers immediately, let questions drive you, let the questions remain. Look at and explore different answers, but let the question be the driving force. Not the first answer. Someone who is full of questions in full of vast potential than someone who has alot of answers.

## The Problem with Statistics
Statistics dont do the work for you. People are going to college saying i have to in order to get a job because thats what the statistics say. The mere fact of going to college because the statistic show that there is a higher chance of higher earnings, it will happen. If you obey the statistical trend you will get the same results just by mere fact of obeying those trends. All your biggest successes will come when you defy statistical predictions. Your existence is a statistical anomaly. Live for opportunities that matter to you and defy the statistics.

## Your Reputation is Your Resume
The vast majority of your jobs are given to people who knew someone at the company. The reason that jobs rarely go to applicants from the outside is because of information. The best information is people who know you by reputation. Even if the person doesnt have a resume, that information alone is of higher value coming from someone within than the best resume that could come from outside. The value of the information is so much higher than that of a static resume. If your resume is the best piece of information about you, that's not going to open any doors. You need to create better information (better richer information). Once you build a greater reputation, you will never need a resume. 

## Creativity is the HTML of Hard Work
The best creators are the ones who know how to get stuff done, regardless of the conditions. Creativity doesnt always sizzle and meaningful work isnt always sexy. Creativity is all about creating. You dont have to be a creative personality type in order to create. You dont have to be in an ideal creative space in order to get things done that are meaningful to you. Good weather doesnt write songs, the beautiful art in coffeee shops dont build businesses, living in a luxury condo wont fill a blank canvas. The action based part of creating is what actually does these things. Anywhere, anytime by anyone who is determined  to fight for their right to create. Plain text is boring, HTML is fun, but HTML cant provide any value until you have that plain text. Its the boring stuff that serves as the foundation  for the exciting stuff. The plain text is the substance. HTML is what gives the substance the form, but the form doesnt matter without any substance. If things were naturally going your way, what use would there be for creativity? none at all! If you desires could be fulfilled without cost, inconveniences or challenges, why would you ever need to get creative? No single work of art, no act of good has ever risen from a completely effortless state or void of the need to deal with somekind of challenge. Creativity is what happens when you go after something and then you have to innovate and improvise around the unexpected or unwelcoming things that happen.

## Creating Content Without a Big Audience 
3 Values to creating content. For learning, signaling and building social capital. There is no better way to learn than having to learn out loud. Dont think on your head. Blog about it, give a talk about it, make a video about it, write a review about it and share it publicly. You learn so much more when you know that your content is going to be seen. Signal creation; creating content around your interests is the best way to signal your capabilities and interests. You are demonstrating is that you are an interesting person, observant, detail oriented person. You are looking for better solutions all the time. The best way to build social capital is to openly brag and create content about the work that you are doing. Hey here are 3 things that i learned in the Praxis bootcamp - o my gosh they are talking about our stuff (smile emoji). Every company is like this.  Learning, signaling and building social capital require no audience at all, monetization or becoming a thought leaader. Its all about content creation and learning out loud and living out loud. You dont have to share every single detail about your life, but the interesting thing is what you are working on and the projects you are doing. The people you are with. It helps you learn, it helps you signal and helps you build social capital. It makes people have a positive association with you and help you later or even work with you. Forget about building an audience, just go out there and create some content for your learning, signaling and your social capital. 

## Babies Dont Baby Step
Babies learn by trying things that they are physically incapable of. Take big , wobbly, inefficient, crazy, experimental, exploratory, curiosity driven, relentless baby steps, like a real baby. Push yourself, take some wild steps

## Shorting Your Own Stock
When you procrastinate on something that you are supposeed to be doing, you are shorting your own stock. To short a stock is to assume that a stock will be worth less in the future (go down). Dont procrastinate just because you can. If you do it now, do it. Why wait? Invest in yourself.
