### Episode 1: Learn Anything Faster

F- Forget
- What you already know (full cup imagery, your mind is like a parachute, it only works when its open) , Situational (multitasking doesnt exist), Limitations if you fight for your limitations you get to keep them. You dont know whats possible.)

A- Active 
- Learning requires you to become active, not passive like the way traditional education is structured. We dont learn through consumption, we learn through creation. You need an activity. Learning is not a spectator sport. Ask questions, create notes, The more active you are, the more you are going to learn.

S- State
- learning is state dependent. Information + Emotion = long time memory. Information + No Emotion = Short term memory. Think of choir, i still remember solfege: Do, Re , Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do. You are responsible for your state. Changing your posture, breathing. As your body moves, your body grooves. All learning is state dependent. State of curiosity. 

T- Teach
- Learn with the purpose or intention of teaching someone else. If you teach it, you get to learn it twice.
