# Only stock investing video you need to watch
You can't beat the market, it's all just a watse of time
- Most stories you hear about are survivorship bias(only success stories).
- All personal finance gurus have made money not from the stock market or investing, but by selling you the dream of investing. Selling you the get rich quick scheme
- Check the credentials of any personal finance advisor or guru who are trying to give you tips. Check how are they making there money. You'll be surprised that these people didnt make their money by investing in stocks. They got their money by telling you and advising other people about investing into he stock markets. They most likely made their money through business, not through the act of investing. 
- Stock investing is not how you become wealthy, but rather how you maintain your wealth. It's how you preserve that wealth,you had to have made it first.
- Techlead quit his job and focused exclusively on day trading and reading religiously every single day. At the end of the day he noticed he had acquired no real skills and knowledge of any value.

# Flutter is Dead on Arrival
- Most of these frameworks tend to overoromise and underdeliver
- Won't fully support the entire apple ecosystem
- Text input won't be as good
- Big issues are dropped on the github page, not addressed
- The mobile development space is very competitive, it's either you go big or go home. Try the apple first approach and then go to android or vice versa 
- Even if you build an app using flutter, you're still gonna have to other tech stacks to optimize your app for other platforms (duplicate infrastructure).

# Blogging is Dead
> I don't agree with this, but I watched it just to see what's up

Video content has superceded blogging. There is definitely some truth to this, he is definitely onto something. 

If you want to blog just journal on a piece of paper. You still get the benefits of blogging.
> Negative mindset, but he makes a point by drawing out that blogging is similar to photography. At this point in time because of the exposure of images on the internet because images no longer posses that wow factor. 

Interesting segawy into saying that apps are dead because the top 30 apps have already been solidified and people won't download anything anymore, unless it makes the ranks. 

People are still trying to build apps  because they have a cool idea, but what the techlead suggests it to look into the future, target the developing areas .


# What is Nocode / Low code Dev?
When the techlead looks at it he senses disruption.
Back in the days companies relied on database administrators (developer)  to help with scale, but now there is a plethora of prebuilt services that help with scale (Amazon AWS, docker, Google cloud developer netis...). 
- People get laughed at because they setup a blog using wordpress and didn't code on their own. There is nothing wrong with that, I mean there is a tool that helps you get the job done. Might as well use the tool to deploy your blog in one button, instead of having to code up the whole thing, so what? Coming up with all the code by yourself is kind of a meaningless struggle. It's exercising utility and that's not what coding is all about. Everyone uses code for their own reasons. Some people use code to make themselves feel more superior.

# Joe Rogan Sold Out to Spotify
Content is king
Every platform shines when they make exclusive content that's only available on their platform
Netflix is king when it comes down to it.
User content for some people is better than highly scripted, big budget shows.
Alot of platforms are trying to be something they are not. 
Facebook video is trying to be YouTube, Spotify wants to be YouTube, YouTube wants to be Netflix
Instagram compliments YouTube because it provides a direct line of connection to the content creators
Reddit compliments YouTube in that it brings about better conversation around videos compared to the YouTube comments alone.

# Will Deno replace Node js
> Creator of node js abandoned node to create Deno
Objective C was replaced by Swift for ios development. Kotlin replaced Java for android development. 

What truly drives language adoption is not syntax. Its not making the user interface look nicer or making the developers lives easier.
What truly drives language adoption is necessity (business need). 

# Best text editor for programming
Android studio ( android) , xcode (ios), VS Code (most used), adam (facebook). Vim and emacs (cult following, no mouse required).
Sublime text ( faster than vscode)

# YouTube Censorship
Censorship is one of the biggest problems with big tech. 
Big tech companies are telling everyone what to think.
We are losing multiculturalism, we are creating a monoculture of western values (America) of silicon valley. In the future everyone will realize that their minds have been plagued by thing branch that's not supposed to be there. 
There are sick people out there who upload child porn, disembodied people and what not. The machine learning algorithm is getting better at filtering out the content, but a large chunk is outsourced to thousands of people who will have ptsd as a result of manually taking down content (content moderation).

Tech companies have a monopoly on communication and it's difficult to compete otherwise (privately owned)

# I dont want to work at google
1. It's too hard to get in
2. You have to work too hard
3. Silicon valley is so expensive
4. I don't wanna be a cog in the machine (fight the system)

> Don't let a stranger on the internet what you can and can't do. (Don't let someone else give you an excuse to not try it out).

If you really want to create change In these companies, why not go in, rise up in the ranks and then you can change the policies, instead of being on the sidelines working at a noname company with no power and just complaining or boycott these services. The best to change a company is to get into the company and change it from within

It took the techlead, 10 years of applying to get into Google. Why give up?  Give it a try and see if you like it. 

Pride holds people back. Compare yourself to yourself, not to some stranger. 

This got me thinking about Malawi . The best way to make changes in Malawi is by actually being in it, instead of living the luxurious life abroad thinking that money can make all the changes. 

It also got me thinking about Ubisoft. I was thinking 9f reaching out to them in order to create a separate team that creates music videos for musicians. 

#  Why you should not become a software engineer

Many people are attracted by the money and prestige of working at a top tier Faang company.
Start coding and see what you can come up with, it's not about the language. That like asking which pot or pan should I use to become a chef? 

Career oriented mindset is devoid of passion. 

Techlead used to teach english in japan. He asked one of his students why they wanted to learn english and the reply was " my job depends on it, I need it to get a job"
His reply was that's not good enough, you won't get far enough because learning a language requires a more valid reason than just work. We are more than just the work we do.

It takes times, you'll spend alot of time on a screen debugging stuff. 

Techlead started by making basic video games. He just wanted to tinker with the technology even if it wasnt the technology used at high end tech companies. 
Explore the technologies and frameworks out there. Build things and explore what's possible and then they can start narrowing down their career path. 

There are two types of programming engineers. People who enjoy coding, hacking the linux kernel , making compilers and barely ship out to the market and make open source frameworks, fixing all sorts of bugs  and nobody really knows their names. They just enjoy the technical challenge, solving puzzles like putting together legos

The second type is more on the entrepreneurial side. They like software and coding. They don't like open source, the idea of working for free, isn't their cup of tea

On the entrepreneurial side, you are not exactly looking to code as much, you have different subset of skills. 
You can entirely build application without ever using code. 

So many people are finding success on the internet, without necessarily have to know how to code or even using code. (This definitely stings because I have been obsessed with learning how to code for the the sake of having that top tier lifestyle and money, without ever realizing, that's not essential)

It's not coding you're after it's the entrepreneurship

# Best programming language

People say that python is the best programming language in the world, but what are you actually doing with that programming language? Are you building websites?  Are you building some machine learning algorithm or data engineering with it? Or are you just writing a bunch of tutorials and solving leet code questions?

Project based learning is the best way to get enthusiastic about programming and to put projects out on your resume.

You can't use python on the front end
Javascript you can ship something for the front end and on the back end as well. You rarely hear people taking about the backend of programming, as opposed to front end. 

It's useless to just learn the syntax of a language, it's best to head in over to the frameworks, the stuff people actually use. For javascript you are talking about react, angular or vue. 
This way you learn exactly what you need to know.
If you want to learn a language you can read through be entire dictionary, but that's useless. It's best to actually go to that country, immersed yourself in the culture and truly find out what words people are actually using on a day to day basis. There are only about 500 words you need to know that are used common day to day basis. That's all you need to know for 90%. The rest you can learn later on the side. (Learn as you go, just in time learning)

Stick to the official language tutorials, so that you are not running yourself into tutorial hell. 

You only need to learn what you need to know in order to build your project

Instead of asking what programming language you should know, ask yourself what framework would you like to learn? That's more important...

Your project decides the tech stack that you should be using.

Flutter for me, Rive app framework ( runtime),  hugo instead of javascript... 

# My response to flutter & react native fanboys
People are defending these cross platform frameworks to the death because they think that aligning themselves to these thechonologies will help them land a job at google or facebook, but that's only further from the truth especially considering the industry standard. Facebook doesn't use react native internally, they moved on to other tech stacks.You optimize for the consumer , not for the developer. Top tech companies are looking for native developers who are at the top of the game.
Are the top 100 apps using hybrid technology like flutter and react native, probably not. These companies are raking in so much money that it makes sense to just hire a second team, ios team and android team. 
Hybrid frameworks will never be first class technologies.

Do you want to build your app with second tier technology? Because that's not how the top apps are built. In technology it's not a sport were you support one team and don't care about the rest. Team A vs Team B, no!  
This type of thinking goes back to the dark ages of vim vs emacs, it's like whatever, nobody cares as long it gets the job done. 

Server rendering technology is what these companies are going towards and not necessarily client side rendueung technology. 

Technology is just a tool, like a hammer. You don't fall in love with your hammer. If the hammer breaks, you swap it out for whatever works and you keep your mind open for whatever future tools that are available at your disposal. 

An interesting comment sort of summarized the argument. 
> These frameworks tend to be great for startups in order to speed up development, but once a startuo goes big, they switch to native  code

Another great comment that probably assassinated the argument is
>  At the end of day just learn native and hybrid technologies

# H-1B Visa abuse by tech companies
Big tech companies usually like to go to low
