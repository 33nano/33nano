Retail Apocalypse- If you don't update/ adapt your business model with the internet you will go down in business.

This is your life, This is your race -You are not competing with anyone or other business. You are competing against yourself.

Make money while you sleep or work until you die (Warren Buffet - on the difference between success and failure)

You can use real estae, stocks, business or whatever, but they all have one thing in common, Systems. When you have a system that works, you dont have to.

Choice is a double edged sword

With every dollar we have,we have the ability to choose our future: Middle class, rich or poor. You have the choice to be rich everyday.

I have no idea what to do… help, i don't know what to do next? These phrase breaks my heart. The only shortcut to success is through mentors, coaches or other people. Find someone who had already done it, talk to them, read their book or find out who coached them.

Creativity is often the solution to not having enough money, or time, or resources.

How much can i risk and still sleep at night?

The most life destroying word off all is to tomorrow

The way to pay less in taxes is to MAKE LESS MONEY.

That is the dumbest advice EVER!

The dollar has value is a scam

The paper that is used to print a dollar on is not actually worth a dollar. The paper does not have the value, it simply represents the value. It is not money because it holds no individual value.

To take it a step further, dollars are actually the OPPOSITE of value. Dollars are debt.

A dollar is a PROMISE to pay back debt.

The U.S. is over a trillion dollars in debt. A trillion is “1” followed by 12 zeroes. It’s a thousand billion. A trillion seconds is 32,000 years. A stack of $1 bills would be 68,000 miles high. So how do we pay back such monumental debt?

Taxes. It’s painful, but it’s obvious.

So, the dollar is the PROMISE of the U.S. government to pay back over a trillion dollars of debt through taxing its citizens. And, to kick you while you are down, the debt is still growing.

The dollar is actually debt.

That is why the rich don’t work for dollars. They work for assets.

Beware of the scam artists,

P.S. – If you need help working on gaining assets rather than working for the dollar, check out my survey. It will link you to your perfect teacher and/or coach based on your goals and interests.

Your ability to manage fear will dictate the level of

success you can attain

As a Marine, I learned that fear, when it takes the form of self-doubt, kills more men than the enemy. The same is true in business - especially in entrepreneurship.

I always say, the ancient idea of getting a safe, secure job and saving for the long term doesn’t work anymore.

Your employer isn’t going to save you. You must save yourself. The good news is that you can… through entrepreneurship.

But to become a successful entrepreneur you must embrace the heart of the Rich Dad B-I Triangle… Systems.

Seth goes on to say:

“Today, the means of production = a laptop computer with Internet connectivity. Three thousand dollars buys a worker an entire factory.”
