Your dream job isnt what you think

You probably have no idea what you want to do

Doctor - hate blood. Lawyer - hate paperwork (focus on interesting opportunities and build your dream from there)

The careers are endless. Making money doing uber, writing tweets, doing tik toks.

Only 27% of graduates get a job in their field of study

Dont try to figure it all out today. Take one opportunity at a time.

Information is cheaper and more accessible than ever before.

Why are so many people spending 4+ years and hundreds of thousands of dollars for information and a credential in college?

If knowledge can be accessed easily, it doesn't make sense to go into debt for it. And based on how quickly information is increasing, it certainly doesn't make sense to prepare for a career in a protected environment instead of launching out into the job market. It's ok not to know exactly what you want to do. In fact, it can be an advantage. This way, you can focus on getting valuable experiences rather than limiting yourself to a specific career.

Things like a value proposition, a customized video pitch, or a dedicated website.

Body of work, offer and selling yourself with a video showcasing your skills

Beats a resume or signal put out by degree and resume holders. Marketing, sales, customer success and operations

From turkey farmer to account manager

A wise man once said,"The graveyard is the richest place on earth, because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take that first step, keep with the problem, or determined to carry out their dream.” I am a lifelong, self driven learner in a world full of too much information. Grinding for XP everyday,leveling up each year, maximizing my HP, hacking the Brain and living life to the fullest. I am a Graphic Designer,Author and Flutter Developer
