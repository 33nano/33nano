1. **How is the book , Limitless, different  from the Kwik Brain podcast?**
- Its not exactly different , but rather a collection of all his podcasts episodes distilled into One


2. **The book talks about small simple steps , what mental model does that language align with?**
- Kaizen

3. **What do you believe makes this book super powerful?**
- I honestly its the fact that when he says that its based on the latest Neuroscience he actually means it. The book clearly contains remnants of Neurolinguistic Programming & Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy

4. **What exactly is limitless about this book?**
- The author essentially creates a mental model called limitless. The limitless mental model is an alliteration of the words Mindset, Motivation & Methods.

5. **What formulas are prevalent in this book?**
- Motivation = Purpose X Energy X Small Simple Steps
