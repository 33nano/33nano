The Main Idea
Human potential is one of the only truly infinite resources which exists in the world. There are literally no limits on your creativity, imagination, and ability to think except those which are self-imposed. If you're not currently functioning at your full potential, there are limits in place which must be released. These limits tend to be in three areas:

A limit in your mindset (the WHAT) — you have incorrect beliefs, attitudes or assumptions.
A limit in your motivation (the WHY) — you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to behave in a more limitless manner.
A limit in your methods (the HOW) — you were taught incorrect processes which will not generate the results you want.
Identify what has been holding you back until now and you have the ability to become limitless in every area that's important to you — academic, health, career, relationships, or personal growth. Free your mind and change your life's trajectory. It can be done.

We all have vast potential inside of us, untapped levels of strength, intelligence, and focus, and the key to activating these superpowers is unlimiting yourself. For more than 25 years, I've worked with people of all ages, nationalities, races, socioeconomic statuses, and education levels. What I've discovered is that no matter where you come from, no matter what challenges you face, you have incredible potential that's just waiting to be tapped. Every person — regardless of age, background, education, gender, or personal history — can advance beyond what they believe they deserve and is possible. And that includes you. Working together, you'll come to think of your own limitations as an outmoded concept.
JIM KWIK
The Three Self-Imposed Limits
1. Element #1 — Mindset (the WHAT). Your mindset — your beliefs, assumptions, and attitudes — are never pre-installed at birth. You've picked them up as you've gone along, and more than likely they are a LIE (Limited Idea Entertained). It's possible to learn how to have a limitless mindset. When you do that, you'll find most if not all of your present constraints are self-imposed. You have to accept that you have the power to assume a limitless mindset. Your true potential is within your control, and once you understand that, the power of that potential grows dramatically.

2. Element #2 — Motivation (the WHY). Contrary to popular belief, your personal motivation is not fixed. It's not something you either wake up with or you don't. Instead, motivation can be generated every day. It's the result of a repeatable process you can control. You can create personal motivation every day by following the recipe: MOTIVATION = PURPOSE x ENERGY x S3. When you combine purpose and energy with small simple steps (S3) in the right direction, you'll be motivated. Do that every day and you'll stay in the state of flow, the ultimate form of productivity.

3. Element #3 — Methods (the HOW). Approaching every day with a productive mindset and the optimum level of motivation is great, but you also need to learn how to learn. You need methods — procedures and processes — which will help your brain excel. Learn savvy methods for how to focus, study a topic, memorize key facts, undertake speed reading, and think clearly. Get good in all these five areas and you will genuinely become limitless.

Summaries.Com Editor's Comments
I hadn't heard much about Jim Kwik before reading his book, but I came away from the experience with respect for the journey he's been on. He has come back from some serious injuries and setbacks as a young person, and has built a solid 20-year career teaching people how to achieve more and do more. Full kudos to Jim Kwik. I really like his motto that learning how to learn is the key to unlocking your innate superpowers, and our capacity to learn as humans is limitless. That's something we believe and live by at Summaries.Com.

The underlying concept of Limitless is that human potential is the only truly infinite resource in the world, and any limits we have are self-imposed. To achieve more, remove the limits in your mindset, your motivation, and the methods you use. Remove those limits, or install expanded and better systems or operating software, and you can tap into the superpowers that you already have. Very motivational and empowering.

This book really makes you think about what you're capable of achieving. It challenges you to reach for the stars, and to become limitless as the title suggests. I think that's a great message to get in the current era when a virus 1,000-times smaller than a grain of sand has bought entire populations and global economies to a grinding and jarring halt. If ever there was a time to expand our thinking and become limitless, this is it.

Great book. Well worth reading and applying.

Introduction
Limitless covers the story of how Jim Kwik taught himself to learn again after he hit his head and suffered a brain injury. Following in his classmates’ footsteps, 5-year-old Kwik had stood on a chair to get a better view of fire engines that were parked outside his school when someone began pulling on his chair. This caused him to fall and land head-first on a radiator. After this injury, he found it hard to memorize basic facts. It took him three years longer to learn to read than his peers. But today, Kwik can recall the names of fifty or more people in an audience that he’s just met. He can also recite a string of one hundred random numbers, forward and back, while onstage. Kwik has gone from never reading a book before the age of 16 to reading a book every week for the last thirty years. At the heart of Kwik’s mental transformation is a simple truth: We all can mold our brains and continuously improve our mental abilities. If you’re struggling to learn, it’s not due to an innate brain limitation. Your struggles with learning are due to either a limited mindset, limited motivation, or a lousy learning method. 

StoryShot #1: The Fundamentals
Jim Kwik starts Limitless by providing fundamental skills. He also encourages readers to use these techniques while reading his book. The method is called the FASTER method. 

F- Forget – The key to focusing on a task is to remove or forget the potential distractions surrounding you.
A- Act – Traditional education has taught most people that it is okay for learning to be passive. That said, your brain does not learn as much by consumption as it does by creation.
S- State – Your learning will always be dependent on the state you are in at that time. This includes both your psychological state (including your thoughts) and your physiological state (including the condition of your body).
T- Teach – Learn with the intention of teaching this information to someone else. If you act as if you will have to give a presentation, you will learn with the intention of mastering it.
E- Enter – Many people enter important tasks in their schedule but forget to enter opportunities for personal growth and development.
R- Review – The “forgetting curve” refers to our tendency to forget information in a short amount of time if we don’t actively try to remember it. To limit the impact of the forgetting curve, you should actively recall what you’ve learned by using spaced repetition. Spaced repetition requires you to practice new and difficult information more frequently than older and less difficult information. You should increase the time interval between each time you review information.
StoryShot #2: The 3 Ms
The 3Ms also form the foundation of limitless learning. The 3Ms are:

Mindset
Motivation
Methods
The unlimiting process supports these points. This process is about removing the limitations you have in each of these three areas because they are critical to your potential capabilities. Your Mindset and Motivation intersect to create your inspiration to learn. This inspiration influences your thoughts, leading to a limitless Mindset of ideation. To then move past the ideation stage, your Motivation and Methods must combine to create implementation. You will have a limitless state if your inspiration, ideation and implementation are all healthy and intersecting. 

Kwik shows us the three self-imposed limits that prevent us from excelling.

Your Mindset (the What) – Your mindset consists of your beliefs, assumptions and attitudes. None of these are preinstalled at birth, which means you pick them up from your environment and those around you. Kwik explains that it is possible to adopt a limitless mindset. This approach allows you to verify that any limitations are self-imposed and that your true potential is within your control. If you can apply this point, your potential grows substantially.
Your Motivation (the Why) – Kwik outlines that your personal motivation is not fixed. Instead, you can generate your motivation every day. That’s because motivation is the result of a repeatable process you can control. Kwik explains that your motivation is a combination of your purpose, energy, and three small and simple steps. 
Your Methods (the How) – As well as approaching every day with a productive mindset, you also need to understand how to learn. So, you need methods. These methods should teach you how to focus, study, memorize critical facts, undertake speed-reading and think clearly. If you can become an expert in these five areas, you will genuinely become limitless.
StoryShot #3: The 4,3,2,1 Method
Henry Ford once said, “Whether you think you can or you can’t, you’re right.” If you insist you can’t read quickly, you’re all but guaranteed to never improve your reading speed. The key to improving any mental ability is to suspend any limiting beliefs and temporarily act as though your mental abilities are limitless. By merely entertaining the idea that your reading speed potential is limitless, you can noticeably increase your reading speed. 

To prove this, consider following the ten-minute exercise called the 4, 3, 2, 1 method. Set a timer for four minutes and open an easy-to-read book. Start reading at a comfortable pace while using your finger to underline the words as you read them. When the four-minute timer expires, mark the point at which you stopped. Now go back to where you started and set a timer for three minutes. Try to get to that same point you reached after four minutes. Don’t worry if your comprehension isn’t perfect. Instead, just make sure you underline and see every word. When the three-minute timer expires, do the same for two minutes, and then one minute. After this 4, 3, 2, 1 exercise, resume reading the rest of the book at a comfortable speed for four minutes. If you compare the number of lines you read now, you will be pleasantly surprised by how much faster you can read. By merely pretending you can read faster, you’ve upgraded your reading speed. 

StoryShot #4: Effective Questions and Acronyms
Before engaging with any learning or task, Jim Kwik encourages readers to ask themselves the following questions:

What do I believe I am capable of?

What have I accomplished in the past?

What is possible for me?

Kwik sums up a negative mindset with the acronym LIE, or Limited Idea Entertained. In essence, most people entertain ideas of themselves that are less than their true potential. Kwik believes these ideas are almost always BS (Belief Systems) that can be challenged.

StoryShot #5: Effective Reading
Consider a book you were forced to read in English class. Then imagine a book recommended by your mentor. This is someone you greatly admire who tells you that this book contains the secret that transformed their life. Which are you more likely to read effectively? After hearing that statement, it’s hard to not wonder what the secret is. If you pick up a book in a peak state of curiosity, wonder and excitement, you are bound to learn quicker and retain more. 

Jim Kwik says all learning is state-dependent. A valid reason why you may not have learned much in school is that you found school boring. So, before you start reading anything, put yourself in a peak state of curiosity. You can do this by asking the following three questions: What great insight will I get from this book? How will this insight forever change my life? And, when will I get to use this insight? Assume that every book you read contains a profound insight. For example, imagine that someone else has just paid ten million dollars for the information you are about to read. With that mental framing, you will become extremely curious and motivated to absorb the information. After you’ve generated ample motivation, it’s time to upgrade your reading methods. 

You can apply this method for reading to all learning. We must produce sustainable motivation.

StoryShot #6: Effective Questions and Equations
As a way of considering your motivation levels, Kwik encourages you to ask yourself the following questions:

How connected do I feel to my purpose?
How are my day-to-day energy levels?
What am I allowing to drain my energy that I no longer should?
Based on these points, Kwik devised a simple equation for what motivation consists of:

Motivation = Purpose x Energy x Small Simple Steps

StoryShot #7: Improve Your Focus By Changing Your Environment
Kwik points out that, when working, we are often using technology. We can work anywhere at any time. So, we become purely focused on our devices rather than the surrounding environment. 

The issue is that our habitual mind is still recognizing the surrounding environment, even if our conscious mind is not. Our mind is using these cues to influence our thoughts and work-related behaviors. So, based on the recommendations of Julia Roy (a famous personal trainer for productivity), there are three ways to improve your focus through changing your environment:

Designate work-only zones.
Set the appropriate soundtrack. Set the same playlist whenever you do a specific task and choose playlists that fit the task.
Give your devices specific tasks. Our brain doesn’t know the difference between the real world and the digital world. We should use a personal phone and work phone, a personal laptop and work laptop, personal iPad and work iPad.
StoryShot #8: Avoid Regression to Improve Your Reading
Regression is the tendency for your eyes to go back and reread certain words in a sentence. Jim Kwik says that almost everyone does it to some degree, and most of the time, we do it subconsciously. 

To solve the problem of regression, you need to use a pacer. Attention follows movement. If you use your finger to guide your reading, you prevent your attention from jumping around the text. Many people have low reading comprehension because reading is too slow and boring for them. But you can get your brain’s attention by moving your pacer more quickly. When you move your finger at a pace that’s on the edge of your perceived maximum reading speed, you require your full attention. More attention equals more retention. So, use a finger as a pacer when reading a physical book. You can also use your finger as a pacer when reading on your phone by sliding it down the side of the phone. Finally, use your mouse as a pacer when reading content on your computer. 

StoryShot #9: Avoid Subvocalization to Improve Your Reading
Bad reading habit number two: subvocalization. Subvocalization is the habit of saying the words to yourself in your head as you read. When you feel the need to sound out every word you read, your reading speed is limited by how fast you can talk. You can get your inner narrator to talk fast and sound out 200–250 words per minute. This rate happens to be the average reading speed. However, there is no need to hear the words in your head as you read them. You’ve already seen 99% of the words before, and you have mental images for most of them. If you can bring to mind the image a word represents, rather than sounding out that word, you’ll become a much more efficient reader. 

To break your subvocalization habit, quietly count out loud as you read. It’s hard for your mind to sound out words and speak numbers simultaneously. So when you start reading, count 1, 2, 3, 4. This process will free your mind of the inner narrator. It  will also train your mind to see the words on the page like images. Turn what you’re reading into a motion picture experience. 

StoryShot #10: Avoid Word-by-Word Reading
The third bad reading habit is word-by-word reading. When you first learn how to read, you train your eyes to look at one word at a time. Now that you’re familiar with most words, you can observe chunks of words at a single glance. Instead of reading “the boy walked home,” you can see all four words simultaneously. 

Practice expanding your vision to see groups of words rather than just one at a time. This technique works in conjunction with the last one because it’s easier for your mind’s eye to generate imagery for groups of words. 

StoryShot #11: Spend 20 Minutes Per Day Training Your Reading Muscles
Remove the perceived limitations on your reading speed by setting aside twenty minutes daily for the next two weeks to build your speed-reading muscle. Each day, forget what you believe your limitations are and pretend for twenty minutes that your potential reading speed is limitless. 

First, grab a book you’ve wanted to read. Take one minute to ask yourself the critical questions: What great insight will I get from this book, and how will this insight change my life? The goal is to put yourself in a peak state of curiosity so that you’re motivated to learn what you read. Then use the following ten minutes to warm up your speed-reading muscles using the 4, 3, 2, 1 method. Afterwards, focus on each of the following methods for three minutes each:

First, use a pacer to prevent regression. As you read, move the pacer at a speed that requires your full attention.
Next, count out loud as you read to stop yourself from subvocalizing the text.
Finally, relax your eyes and expand your peripheral vision to try to take in more than one word at a time. 
When you first start using these three methods (pacing, counting and expanding), you’ll feel a little awkward. But if you continue using them, you’ll start to see your speed and reading comprehension improve dramatically. 

StoryShot #12: The Ten Steps to Improving Your Memory
Kwik provides ten steps for improving your memory.

Eat good brain food: What you eat matters, especially to your brain matter. Blueberries are great brain food.
Try to avoid negative thoughts and complaining.
Exercise regularly.
Get your brain nutrients: Take a blood test and verify your deficiencies. Then take the appropriate supplements.
Keep a positive peer group: Who you spend time with is who you become. This point is supported by research into mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are activated as we observe others. When we see someone else doing something, our mirror neurons activate as if we were doing the same thing. 
Maintain a clean environment, meaning clean air, water and space around you.
Get good sleep: Dreaming is essential for fantastic ideas. Sleep is also vital for protecting you against age-related brain damage, and it is crucial for day-to-day functioning.
Protect your brain: Avoid putting your phone under your pillow and protect yourself from head injuries by wearing a helmet when cycling.
Learn new things: Neuroplasticity (connections in your brain) can be instigated through learning new things.
Reduce your stress through yoga, meditation, or massages.
You must also try to frequently challenge your methods by asking yourself the following questions:

Have I thought about the methods I am using?
Have I learned this method from someone successful at what I am trying to achieve?
If I changed my method, would my results look different?
StoryShot #13: The 4Ds
As well as optimizing the 3 Ms, Kwik talks about the 4 Ds that can make living a limitless life difficult in the modern world. These are:

Digital Deluge – We consume significantly more data now in one day than a person centuries ago would have in their entire lifetime. This can leave our brain overwhelmed.
Digital Distraction – Instead of relaxing into our time, we often pull our phones out. This ultimately trains our distraction muscles.
Digital Dementia – Overreliance on technology could lead to us no longer honing our cognitive abilities. We should look at our brains more like a muscle rather than a hard drive. 
Digital Deduction – The automation of critical thinking and problem-solving makes us much worse at these skills, but we will always need these skills in life.

A king was watching a great magician perform his act. The crowd was enthralled and so was the king. At the end, the audience roared with approval. And the king said “What a gift this man has. A God-given talent.”

But a wise counselor insisted “My Lord, genius is made, not born. This magician’s skill is the result of discipline and practice. These talents have been learned and honed over time with determination and discipline.”

The king refused to accept the message, saying “How dare you criticize a true genius. As I said, you either have it or you don’t. And you most certainly don’t.” The king turned to his bodyguard and ordered to throw the counselor to the deepest dungeon. He added “So you won’t be lonely, you can have two of your kind to keep you company. You shall have two piglets as cellmates.”

From the very first day of his imprisonment, the wise counselor practiced running up the steps of his cell to the prison door caring in each hand a piglet. As the days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, the piglets steadily grew into sturdy boars. And with every day of practice the wise consoler increased his strength and power.

One day the king remembered the counselor and was curious to see how imprisonment had humbled him. So, the king had him summoned.

When the prisoner appeared, he was a man of powerful physique, carrying a boar each arm. The king surprised, “What a gift this man has. A God-given talent.”, to which the counselor replied “My Lord, genius is made, not born. My skill is the result of discipline and practice. These talents have been learned and honed over time with determination and discipline.”

Genius is made, not born.

10 Ways to Generate Limitless Brain Energy

Resiliency expert Dr. Eva Selhub often likens the brain to a high-performance vehicle. In her own words: “Like an expensive car, your brain functions best when it gets only premium fuel. Eating high-quality foods that contain lots of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants nourishes the brain and protects it from oxidative stress – the waste produced when the body uses oxygen, which can damage cells.” We know for sure that there’s a direct connection between a good diet and a healthy brain.


Diet affects brain function. There are readily available sources for all nutrients but getting them sufficiently into your diet isn’t always possible. That’s where supplements come into play. Remember not all supplements are created equal so make sure to do your research.


When your body moves, your brain grooves. Heidi Godman, the executive editor of the Harvard Health Letter puts it this way, “Exercise changes eh brain in ways that protect memory and thinking skills.” You don’t need a full gym membership to get a good workout. The key is to be active and moving. Even 10 minutes of aerobic exercise a day can go a long way.


Jim refers to managing your beliefs and emotions as ‘killing ANTs’. ANTs are Automatic Negative Thoughts. If you’re like most people, you hold limiting beliefs at least some of the time. Maybe you tell yourself you aren’t smart enough to learn a skill you want. Maybe you believe you can’t lose weight because you don’t have self-control. ANTs are everywhere. You can avoid them. Only when you kill them can you truly accomplish what you want to accomplish.


The air you breathe is critical to your brain functions. If you’ve ever been stuck in a room with a smoker, you know how hard it is to think clearly. Conversely, if you’re hiking in the mountains, you can feel your sense thriving. Most of us are living in cities but we can clean the air in our homes, offices and create clutter-free workspaces. Remove all unnecessary stuff. As Marie Kondo says, “Does this spark joy?”. If the answer is no, simply throw it away.


You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Certainly, your peers affect the way you think and talk but it doesn’t stop there. They can affect everything from what you eat to how much you exercise and even how much sleep you get.


It goes without saying that protecting your brain is critical if you want to make the most of it. After all, you have only one brain. Hard-contact or extreme sports are not ideal if you want to use your brain power to the fullest. Driving a motorcycle 20 miles per hour all the time doesn’t help either. If you love these things too much to give them up, at least take as many precautions as you can.


As long as we keep learning new things, we can develop new neural pathways in our brains. This is known as neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is most effective when we stretch ourselves in our learning. Attempting to master a skill, discovering a new challenge and embracing new cultures can all keep your neurons firing and creating neural pathways.


Harvard Health Blog says, “There’s evidence that chronic stress may actually rewire your brain.” If stress happens occasionally, it’s not really a problem. But you’re stressed all the time, the buildup of cortisol in your brains can lead it to cease functioning optimally. Finding ways to reduce stress becomes paramount as more and more evidences indicate the link between stress management and brain functions.


To say that sleep can do miracles for your brain is an understatement. If you want to make good decisions, sleep better. If you want to think clearly, sleep better. If you want to learn faster, sleep better. If you want to lose weight, sleep better. And the list goes on. Quality sleep is as essential as food and water. Without it, you will find it harder to perform everyday tasks. So, get enough sleep, better yet get enough quality sleep.

 

Top 10 Foods For Your Brain
Avocado
Blueberry
Broccoli
Coconut Oil
Eggs
Green leafy vegetables
Salmon and sardines
Turmeric
Walnut
Dark chocolate

Try to remember the list as much as you can, in any way you like. You have one minute.

Ready? Let’s move onto how we can drastically increase our memory, using association technique.

 

Remember Anything #1 Association

Imagine 10 parts of your body:

Head
Nose
Mouth
Ears
Neck
Shoulders
Chest
Hands
Belly
Seat/Hips
Now, we’ll apply association technique to remember “top 10 foods for your brain”. To begin, simply assign our brain diet to our body parts.


Head –> Avocado (imagine the shape of the avocado resembles the shape of your head)
Nose –> Blueberry (imagine two blueberries sticking right up your nostrils)
Mouth –> Broccoli (imagine the broccoli full in your mouth)
Ears –> Coconut oil (imagine the coconut oil spilling out of your ears and feel it)
Neck –> Eggs (imagine the egg in your neck)
Shoulders –> Green leafy vegetables (imagine spinach and kale sitting on top of your shoulders)
Chest –> Salmon and Sardines (imagine your chest as if it were a chunk of salmon)
Hands –> Turmeric (imagine the turmeric powder on your hands)
Belly –> Walnuts (imagine and feel the walnuts protruding your belly)
Seat/Hips –> Dark chocolate
As simple as that. You can use association technique to store virtually any list you can think of. It will dramatically improve your chances of remembering what you learnt. Try it now!

 

Remember Anything #2 Chain Linking

In addition to ‘basic association’ we saw earlier, you may try using ‘chain linking’ technique to store your learning in long-term memory. Consider the words below:

Fire Hydrant
Balloon
Barrel
Board
Diamond
Sir Lancelot
Mask
Toothpaste
Sign
Bar
Let’s see ‘chain linking’ in action. Imagine the ‘balloons’ tied to the red vivid ‘fire hydrant’. The balloons seemingly come from the ‘barrel’. Inside the barrel, there is a ‘board’ that closely resembles the shape of a ‘diamond’. The diamond drops on ‘Sir Lancelot’ head. He is then rushed to emergency in a ‘mask’. The ‘mask’ as it turns out is dirty that it needs to be cleaned with ‘toothpaste’. The leftover toothpaste is thrown away and now stuck at the ‘sign’ outside the ‘bar’.

 

Remember Every Name: BE SUAVE
Believe – once you believe you can do it, you’re already halfway there
Exercise – keep practicing until you become very good at it
Say – say the person’s name back right after you heard it, that way you’d have heard the name twice
Use – use the person’s name throughout the conversation
Ask – ask where the person’s name come from, especially if it’s less-common
Visualize – attach an image to person’s name
End – part ways by saying the person’s name
 

7 Habits to Un-limit Your Studies

Habit #1 Employ Active Recall
Dr. William Klemm of Texas A&M University wrote, “Most students do not realize how important it is to force themselves to recall. In part, this is because they’re conditioned by multiple-choice tests to recall passively, that is recognize when a correct answer is presented, as opposed to generating the correct answer in the first place.” Klemm added “Optimal learning occurred when an initial learning session included repeated study and forced-recall testing of all items at least four times in a row.”

Habit #2 Employ Spaced Repetition
Cramming isn’t a stranger to most learners. On one hand, it’s natural to procrastinate. On the other hand, it’s tempting to pick up a tremendous amount of material all at once. The problem is neither of these approaches works. By spacing the intervals out, you’re exercising neural connections each time. As opposed to cramming, spaced repetition produces long-term and robust retention of knowledge. Spaced repetition works best when you review material at similar intervals.

Habit #3 Manage the State You’re In
When your body moves, your brain grooves. If you’re feeling great, the greater results you’ll produce. Studying is no different. The easiest way to change your state of mind is to move your body. Stand up, if you can’t sit up right. Chest out and shoulders back. Doing so facilitates breathing and improves circulation of oxygen to your brain and the rest of your body.

Habit #4 Use Your Sense of Smell
Did this ever happen to you? You walked into a room and smelled the air filled with a scent. That scent immediately send you back to a day with a childhood friend. Have you ever wondered why would a particular smell trigger that memory?

Smells bring memories to the forefront of our brains. The scent of rosemary has been shown to improve memory. Peppermint and lemon promote concentration.

 



 

Habit #5 Music for the Mind
Numerous studies link music to learning. “Music stabilizes mental, physical and emotional rhythms to attain a state of deep concentration and focus in which large amounts of content information can be processed and learned.” Said Chris Boyd Brewer, music and learning expert. Baroque music stands out in particular, although one’s reaction to music is deeply personal.

Habit #6 Listen with Your Whole Brain
We spend a large percentage of our waking hours listening. Unfortunately, most of us are not very good at it. “While listening is the core of most of our communications – the average adult listens nearly twice as much as they talk – most people stink at it.” wrote Bob Sullivan and Hugh Thompson in their book The Plateau Effect. One possible reason we don’t listen so well is we tend not to apply all our brainpower. To help address problem, remember the acronym HEAR – Halt, Empathy, Anticipate, Review.

Habit #7 Take Note of Taking Notes
At its best, note-taking allows you to process the information much more deeply and in a way that makes it most likely that you can use it afterwards. To take notes effectively, be sure you understand why you’re doing it. The goal of taking notes in a lecture might be very different from taking notes during a work presentation.

Once you’re clear on your goals, listen with intent. Write your notes in a way you can understand later. Equally important is to use your own words whenever possible. Handwriting triumphs typing because writing by hand requires you to exert more effort and process information immediately, and that has proven to be more effective.

Use a method “Capture and Create”. Fold the paper into two columns. One left side, write down what you’re capturing, i.e., take notes. On the right, write your impression of potential applications, i.e., the areas you can apply this.

 

4 Quadrants of Active Learning

Quadrant #1 Visualization
Think of your bed. Did you see a queen-size mattress with a wooden headboard, blue sheets and giant pillows? Or did you see the word “bed”? Our minds think in terms of concrete pictures. A picture is worth a thousand words. The same is true in learning.

Quadrant #2 Association
To remember any new piece of information, associate it with something you already know. Whether you realize it or not, you’ve done this all your life. Here’s a simple test. Think of a cherry. What comes to your mind? Perhaps red, sweet, fruit, pie, round, seeds, etc. These are words and pictures you’ve learned to link to a cherry.

Quadrant #3 Emotion
Emotion + Association = Long-term Memory

This is worth repeating. Adding emotion to association registers your new information in long-term memory. Regardless of the emotion you use, emotion makes retention much more robust and durable.

Quadrant #4 Location
We’re really good at recalling places because we don’t’ need to remember any words nor numbers. If you can associate something you just learnt with a place, you’re familiar most, you’re much more likely to remember it.

 

Reading: An Essential Ingredient
To say, “I don’t read” is essentially saying “I’ve stopped trying to learn.” Yes, you can learn from watching videos, listening to podcasts and going to movies even. But it’s nearly impossible to replicate the experience of reading.

Reading is extremely rewarding for your brain.
Reading improves your memory.
Reading improves your focus.
Reading improves your vocabulary.
Reading improves your imagination.
Reading improves understanding.
Speed Reading: Self-Assessment
It’s difficult to improve something you can’t measure. To improve your reading, start off by assessing your ‘base rate’. The base rate in measured in ‘words per minute’.

Set alarm for two minutes.
Read at a comfortable pace and stop when the alarm goes off (put a mark where you finish).
Count the total number of words in three regular lines and divide that by three. You will get average number of words per line.
Count the number of lines you just read.
Multiply the number of words per line and the number of lines.
Divide this number by two. You will get your current words per minute.
The average person will fall somewhere between 150 to 250 words per minute. If you’re reading below 100, chances are the material may be too difficult for you. But let’s say you read at 200 words per minute. A person who reads at 400 only needs to exert half the time and accomplish just as much.

Speed Reading: Myths
Myth #1 Fast readers don’t comprehend well.
This is a rumor probably spread around by slow readers. It’s just not true. Here’s an analogy. When you’re taking a slow drive down your neighborhood, you can do many things. You may be listening to the radio, drinking a soda, waving to a neighbor and even singing your favorite track. It’s easy to let your attention wander all over the place. But imagine you’re driving pedal to the metal down a racetrack. Do you focus more or less?

Myth #2 It’s harder and takes more effort to read fast.
Again, nothing could be further from the truth. Reading fast actually requires less effort. Slow readers go through word by word, regress to a previous one and so on. Fast readers go through words much easier and in a lot less time, thereby accomplishing more with less.

Myth #3 Fast readers don’t appreciate reading.
This isn’t true either. You don’t have to study individual brushstrokes to enjoy a masterpiece. And you don’t have to comprehend every single word in a book to realize its value.

Speed Reading: Problems
There are basically three problems that prevent us from reading quickly:

Regression – your eyes constantly go back to reread certain words
Outdated skills – the last time you read was probably in school
Sub-vocalization – you keep saying the words in your mind as you read
 

3 Easy Fixes To Read Faster

Fix #1 Give your reading the finger. 
Use your finger as a visual pacer to keep your eyes focused and prevent them from wandering. Doing so improves your reading speed because your eyes are attracted to motion. It seems a bit awkward but remember it takes more effort to sharpen your skills first than it does to bulldoze your way through learning later.

Fix #2 Don’t move the body. Move the book.
Don’t bend your head down. Bring the book up and maintain good breathing.

Fix #3 Avoid moving your lips as you read.
This will help you stop vocalizing the words to yourself.
