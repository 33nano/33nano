A 20 year old university students gets transported yo another world (isekai)
This manhwa is about a character by the name, Kim Kibong who gets transported to another world (isekai). It just so happens that an error occurs in this fantasy world and he is unable to escape. He dies countlessly in this world, and his body regenerates every time. An endless cycle of torture, strength building and leveling up. Luckily enough, one day he is able to return to planet Earth, but it's no longer the same, dungeons infested with monsters appear out of nowhere each and every day, and it just so happens that he finds himself in the middle of this chaos. His deep hatred for monsters fuels him to slay the monsters and out of the blue he recalls a familiar figure. Thinking that he lost everything he is able to save his mother. As time progressed he assembles a special division of heroes, thanks to the recognition by the government of whom trusts to protect his family. 

Kim Kibong is technically an immortal, but some heroes drowning in their own pride dare to challenge him.
One mysterious hero stalks him everyday, but all this man seeks is friendship. He dares test kim Kibong, but fails. That doesn't stop him from clinging onto kim Kibong who just decides to make him a part of his team

The biggest incident by far happens to be something that one of the largest guilds in this story plans to lure Kim Kibong, by awakening one of the most feared creatures, a dragon. It just so happens that the dungeon only enables him and his companion to go through, and filters out the rest of his team. Stuck in this predicament there plan is set in motion, but the person they relied on gets demolished to a point that he is no longer identifiable. However kim Kibong in this situation has his HP drop significantly because the weapon of the wielder reflected every attack that was pounced on it, (the weapon eventually crumbled).
After the big raid he receives a ton of press and gets called on a top mission to a dungeon that only requires 3 people.
