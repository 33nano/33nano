A bullied student fails at his attempt of commiting suicide, but a grim reaper is enticed by this boy. The rule of contract is the ability to use former powers of the dead for one hour which substracts 1 year from his life span. Not only does he agree to this, but he only wants to be left with one year (take everything and leave me with one year).
The first time he borrowed strength from the king of boxing muhammad ali to get himself out of s tough situation
