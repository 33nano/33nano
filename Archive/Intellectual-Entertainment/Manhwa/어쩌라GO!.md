This was purely intellectual entertainment, but probably more libido entertaining than intellectual. The biggest takeaway is probably that I learned what the word eunuch means, so anytime that word pops up, I have something to associate it with. 

Funny enough, this is first manhwa that I ever read. By read I mean completed, it was probably the second thing I read after dropping God of highschool, another manhwa that has nothing to do with education and has a progressively complicated plot.
