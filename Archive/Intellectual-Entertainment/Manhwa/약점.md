There is no better way to describe this manhwa other than saying, I got tired of it. It has a great beginning, but seemingly gets complicated in a sense that resembles reality than the nature of fantasy. My expectations of a fast paced story with quick resolutions was in the comical nature, a true fantasy. It's a complexly dragged story and not as methodical as Mr Kang, a manhwa with similar upbringings.

It's about a parachute employee who was offered a simple role at a giant law firm. He doesn't do much except fix computers when they are broken and a couple of other odd tasks. The first impression the mc gives off is that off someone cynical, but not not extreme like the character in the Lookism manhwa or the manga, Tokyo Ghoul. In his little office, he is rarely bothered, some would even say invisible. One of the interesting things about his office is that he has a cctv monitor that allows him to peek into the areas if the firm that are not shown in the security room. Turns out this law firm isn't all that the media portyrsys because it's filled with powerful that abuse their power, by that I mean sexual subjugation of women. One of his female managers catches him with the tablet thinking it's a tablet full of porn. The payment she demands is that of her bodily satisfaction. In the story she is merely a fuck buddy that can help him out, as long as she is satisfied sexually. One of the women is a reciptionisr and she is a victim of one of the lawyers and basically a play thing. Not until she forms an alliance with the parachute employee. One day he saves her from a brutal double penetration... Basically they have a dating like relationship. Another woman comes into the picture but she is a lawyer with a a really nasty secretary. Turns out the lawyer once was a prostitute and he noticed by the mark on her chest due to an accident in the elevator ( she is claustrophobic). Story progress is good, but one day too serin breaks ties with him after firing her secretary. He isn't affected much because he has a girlfriend and tons of fuck buddies.
