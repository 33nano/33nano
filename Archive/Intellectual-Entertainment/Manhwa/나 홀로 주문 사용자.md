Solo spell caster is a manhwa that pretty recycles the whole isekai , dungeon , game world story. It's a story about a salary man park do hyuk , who finds himself in the middle of a dungeon break. Somehow his body is shocked and he stands frozen, just when you think that the monsters would kill him in a swing, his body reacts. He has just been awakened, his special capability is magic. His power outperforms his rank, but nobody knows this.  
Side note: KBI is the name of the organization that is in charge of managing the awakened
He quits his job with his newfound abilities and start making money by selling stuff he replicates with his ability and other stuff he finds by clearing dungeons

One particular day he made 300 million won in one go because the corpses of the monsters he defeated were well preserved. Other heroes preed at this hero with zelous eyes and planned to kill him and steal his possessions. While he was trying to strengthen his skills at a field (places where monsters have settled, but are blockaded by a fence thanks to the KBI)  a group of men approached him , they even had their eyes on his vehicle (super rugged armor truck).
He brutally wrecks these three behemoths and somehow this violence was filmed and goes viral on the web(this all happened in the field).
He decides to auction himself in front of the top guilds. He displays his capabilities, but none are impressed and only two guilds are left. He decides to show his trump card, the ability to crwt items like drones. One particular guild takes interest in him and he is contractors, as opposed to a member.

The things he crafts make other guilds reconsider,but he is happy where he is at. He has access to all sort of spells and they truly value his well-being.
Another product he released happens to be something unique that enables people to identify the hidden capabilities in their relics and appraise them. KBI decides to step in because they realize that if they don't act, some foreign nation will take him instead.
