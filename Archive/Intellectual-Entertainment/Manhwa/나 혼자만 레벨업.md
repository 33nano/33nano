Solo leveling is a manhwa that is at the pinnacle off popularity in the same mannerism as Berserk is to manga. One could even say that it draws upon various tropes that reocurr in most manga and mashes them into a fine dish of fervent fantasy.

My analysis and interpretation will drawn from the true source of this story the light novel which is widely adapted and updates on a weekly basis into a manhwa. 

The story begins with a low rank character who struggles to make ends meet in dungeon raids as a hunter. He is a burden onto his team and he is constant need of healing, they only keep him around because of his tenacity. One particular day his embarks upon a dual dungeon. A dungeon inside a dungeon (entrance door). The atmospheric vibe of this dungeon is very menacing. The entire team is almost completely wiped out, a few a escape and there is but one sacrifice who must stay in this ominous dungeon. Turns out jinwoo stays, but who would care if he died? He is killed by this dungeon and reawakened with stronger powers and a game system that follows him. They send a rescue team to recover the dead bodies and find jinwoo unconscious. He later wakes up in a hospital, but turns out his body is fine, but something seems off. He sees a daily task pop up of three exercises that he must do everyday, 100 crunches, 100 sit-ups and 10km run. Coincidence? I think not! It's very similar to the one punch man workout, if he doesn't do it there is a penalty. The penalty is being transported to a dungeon where he either has to survive for a duration of time or fight off all the monsters. 
He slowlly discovers his abilities and picks a class. He is a shadow monarch (necromancer). He is able to turn his goes into allies, more specifically shadow soldiers. 
One time he does a raid with another low rank hunter who happens to take an interest in him. This man helps him access the hefty priced dungeons. One time he helps out with a raid that some guild had secured. There is only 1 A rank hero among them and the rest are C crank and lower. The dungeon later turns into a red gate, meaning it's difficulty cannot be determined, but certainly harsh. Luckily those who stuck with jinwoo survive. The guild leader is infuriated and demands answers, but jinwoo says you better be thanking me instead and then leaves. The guild leader converses with his surviving guild members and he makes the call to try and recruit this man at all cost. 

One time he volunteers as a porter for one of the best guilds in south Korea. The guild members suffer severe wounds, but luckily enough jinwoo got the heads up from the guild master (not owner) to help with the situation (approved). The division team heads in and even the top ranked female hunter goes in to see what the situation. To their surprise, a complete turns of events. Jinwoo and his shadow took care of the entire situation. Pleased with the results he decides to make the orc, the dungeon boss one his soldiers. He just displayed the highest performance beyond S rank in front of the top guild and monitoring division. 

In the evaluation room the chairman/ national rank hunter of south Korea invites jinwoo to showcase his abilities in a small room. The other witnesses are two guild owners, who both have received help from jinwoo. The magical energy he outputs blows their minds, he shows his complete soldier army.
