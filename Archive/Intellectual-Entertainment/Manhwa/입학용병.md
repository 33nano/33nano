Ijin, the mc has extensive combat experience from his past which is slowly unveiled in short flashbacks in the manhwa. He was advised not to get into any fights at his school as a high school senior transfer, but he ends up breaking that promise. His use of combat is justified as a means of self defense and protection for his sister who happens to be a victim of bullying. One thing is certain, no matter who he faces in combat he comes back unscathed.

1. The first bully the mc approaches happens to be two siblings from a rich family. These siblings, brother and sister have major influence in the school, one could almost say that they are at the top of the food chain.
The brother and his gang was beaten twice and left with a strong warning and he completely stopped, but his sister on the other hand didnt surrender. She made her parents hire an assassin of whom failed at the attempt and coincidentally become friends at the end. The mc eventually evades the residence of the family defeating all the guards and making his way to the parents. The discussion ends with the mc demanding that he never sees the siblings in the school and that any further attempts will lead to the  family's downfall.

Next thing the acts of bullying are announced on television along with  fradulous acts that the family has been commiting which was obtained from the assassin
