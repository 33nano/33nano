# Bootstrap

This site was created using the Bootstrap Studio desktop application

This project was later abandoned due to the lack of support that the team provides, overbloated nature of the widgets and my inability to convert the project into singular files. I was unable to convert my site to a simple index.html , one single javascript files and and a singular css file. I gave up trying to find a solution and just decided to use something simpler instead.
