If you dont control what your children watch/consume, they will most likely end up gay. Just because its a cartoon doesn't make it harmless. I've seen frozen.

"i was born this way"
People are not born gay. Being gay is a choice

Lets take a step back into the field of Neuroscience, i mean psychology.
The buzzword of the day is Tabula Rasa which means blank slate. When we are born are mind is blank. Who that child becomes all depends on his/her environment, parents and just about everything they experience during their childhood, this is called the imprint period. 80% of your personality is developed during this time. psychologists would say that your brain is fixed and you cant change it, but that not true. Thats why Neuroscience exists. A child is not born a terrorist, but they can be trained to become one. Just like how Americans train their children and how society trains them to believe that America is the best country in the world, Africa is a country full of huts, povety and diseases, People in the middle east are terrorists, Russia and China are our enemies, You can become whoever you want. All of these lies designed for you to stay to face the harsh reality that the war on terror is fake and just an excuse to steal oil. African is not a country, its a continent, Americans only choose to share the negative aspects of African countries. All the foreign aid and donations are just an excuse to make money and exploit the nations of their resources and land. China and Russia are considered enemies because they are the only countries that America has failed to conquer or control like the rest of the world. The realization that higher education is overpriced for no tangible reason and it doesnt prepare people for the ever changing job market.
