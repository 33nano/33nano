# Hypocrite Antithesis

Why? I ask myself, after finally figuring out the problem. I am aware that i can create the funds to buy whatever i want, but how come nothing changes? I keep telling myself that change is only a few dollars away. If i buy that book and read, if i buy those supplements and use them, if i buy that udemy course and complete it, if i buy that piece of tech and utilize itâ€¦ Its at this point i figured out the real problem. Buying stuff was just one out the other habits that have been killing my psychological and physical growth. What every habit that i have formed have in common is the antithesis of an active lifestyle. Watching anime, masturbating, eating junk food, spending countless hours on my phone, watching YouTube, reading books, reading manga, eating for the sake of curing boredom, listening to podcasts and so on. The problem is that i have been living this passive lifestyle of consuming information and inactivity with the thought that change would magically happen. What Kaizen Oasis needs is an active lifestyle full of daily creation and activity. The problem that comes to face me isnt that i dont know, its that i dont know how to apply.

Meditation

I need to utilize my muse headset for this. Meditation is active because it involves the act of confronting that self talk voice in your head, the little negative homunculus in your mind. If i dont utilize meditation how much longer will i maintain my fake composure?

Exercise

Its sad that i have reverted to my old lifestyle. The only time i truly exercised was back in high school. Prior to that the only that i relied on was my high metabolism. After my high school graduation in 2017 i called it quits. I reverted to the reliance of high metabolism. Will my high metabolism be enough to help me with the hereditary diseases in my family?

Writing

Talking isnt my strong suit, but give me some materials and you will astonished by my writing skills. Writing enabled me to change who i was, but i have been consistent after high school.

Time

I cant turn back time, but i can turn my mental models around to live an active, physically fit, total memory recall, peaceful and meaningful lifestyle like i did back in high school.
