4 quotes: Death is the greatest motivator of all because it renders anything useless. When we look into its eyes or imagine it our senses are appalled and priorities heightened for survival

“The message in every self help book is change your brain change your life

This life is temporary dont get too attached to it. Another life awaits you long after your immortality project subsides.

“Time is the greatest enemy. The young say i have long life ahead of me, while the old say life is short. We are all given the same amount of time, but the quality that we bestow unto our bodies and mind determines everything

Page 2: Death is the end of all, time is teacher, but the only weapon you have in this world is your brain. If you change it, you can change your life

Page 7: Quotes

We are more often frightened than hurt ad we suffer more from imagination than we do in reality

When we are no longer able to change a situation , we are challenged to change ourselves

If you dont live for something, you will die for nothing. Seek to die with memories not dreams. Death is the wish for some, relief of many and the end of all

All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his thoughts. Thought is the fountain of character, life and manifestation. For as a man thinketh in his heart so is he. His character being the complete sum of all his thoughts

Maturity is what happens when a person learns to give a fuck about whats truly fuckworthy

The secret of happiness is not found in the pursuit of more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.

We cannot add or subtract years from our life. We can only live in the moment and try to make the best of it. Its never too late to become do anything as long as you are not disabled and have a functional brain

Self improvement doesn’t expire

Your network is your net worth because content is fire and social media is gasoline

Conclusion

I like to keep my story short… I was born in Malawi, a country located in South East Africa. If you didnt know about it thats fine because the only thing you need to know is that its the poorest country on planet Earth. The poverty cannot be expressed in simple pictures because you would have to travel and experience it for yourself to fully understand it. I lived there for the first 13 years and 9 months of my life before I came to America. I came here through a man who claimed to be my real father, the person who told me that I was a result of an affair. It made sense to me because my sister had a different last name and still does even after the passing of my step dad. The one thing that I truly found fascinating about America wasnt the people, the food or the fancy stuff, but my first encounter with this magical thing called the Internet. At the age of 13 I learned about Wifi and this thing called a browser. Kids in America have grown up with access to the internet, while at the age of 13 this was my first time. I felt the same way that old people feel when they buy a tech gadget and have their grandkids show them how to use it. Except this time it was my friends that I made in high school that showed me how to use it. The first big thing that I ever did aside from literally seraching what is the internet on Google was creating a google account. My friends helped me create my first email. When I went back home I created a facebook account and immediately started connecting with my friends and family back home to never told me about this technology before. The internet has a plethora of resources and its the tool that unlocked my mind. The internet has allowed me to connect with people, given me access to resources paid or free and most of all has helped me find something to pursue. When people asked me about who I wanted to when I grown up my answer always changed, but I found my own answer. I tell people that I want to a computer animator, but deep down the real answer is a developer.
