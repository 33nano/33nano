> A dermatologist is a doctor who specialized in skin care. This essay is simply an analysis of what humanity has come to in regards to skin care. Television has been a great influencer. This essay is by no means a medical research paper, reader discretion is advised.

### The Earths capital of platic surgery
> South Korea

### Old Skin
> The field of dermatologist from the past

The richest doctors whose job adds no real value to humanity
Does one really need a dermatologist?
Facial peelers sheath the old skin and behold the new
Facial masks cleanse the old skin and behold the new
Hyper pigmentation is the enemy of all humanity
Oil uncanny robbing the skin of its youth
If skin care products worked, why do they hide the truth?

### New Skin
> The current version of the dermatology practice

Makeup is kinda like steroids. Your power level will go over 9000, but you're still ugly at the end of the day

### All Natural?
> With the perceived artificial advancements is it even humanly possible to achieve such a fine degree of fine skin care through nature alone?

Ice facials are the solution
