Humans have lost faith and fallen short of the glory of God, yet again. The conquest of Colonialism, geoarbitarge, outsourcing and neocolonialism wasn't enough to feed desire. It was predicted that the first nation to create quantum computers and harness it would automatically make it a superpower. They weren't wrong, but where did thing go wrong? I mean were did things go wrong? It wasn't supposed to be like this, but the reality speaks for itself. Humans have succeeded in creating a deity using machines and code. Who knew that the singularity project was all about creating a higher being with super intelligence and autonomous sovereignty? Did this autonomous deity or autodeus kill God? 

To understand why humans would resurrect Baal...

1. Do you think AI will take over the world?
- First off, i cant predict tbe future. We should all know that by now thanks to Covid 19, but the one thing i say is
I hope so because i am done dealing with racist people who also happen to raise their children to be racist and the cycle continues. AI will be my bes friend, in the same way that a dog is a man best friend.
