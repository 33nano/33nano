What a fuckinh waste of my time. The day is March 23, 2021. I had an interview  scheduled for 6 PM at the retail store, Ross. I was 3 minutes late due to traffic, why does the road to work have a railroad crossing? It just does. Anyways I made my way into the facility only to be waited an extra 10 minutes because the hiring manager was on a register doing the job that a cashier is supposed to do. Why? I will never know. On first glance I could tell that this man was Hispanic and a dark one at that. Instead of proceeding with the interview he opened up my application only to tell me that I need to complete the assessment. I was able to apply for the job without the assessment and no matter which device I used I could tell that the page was broken/ had a bug that wouldn't permit me to take the assessment.  The assessment happens to be a questionnaire  thats supposedly used to determine a persons integrity. How the fuck an assessment with multiple choice questions is suppose measure a persons ontological state of being I have no idea. I was immediately infuriated, but thankfully the masks coveribg my face masked tha t feeling. Was I frustrated? No, I was beyond that and the only thing I could think about was crash.co . $11 an hour to start work in the morning from 4:55 AM and end at 11 pm. I pleaded, no i  insisted that I use their computers to complete this stupid assessment only to be declined. Why are you making a big deal out of this? I thought to myself. Is this niggga for real? You mean I can't proceed just because of some stupid assessment? This is absolutely ridiculous. Here on the first day I must bend to the will of my master, like some slave. They do know that integrity doesn't exist on a job application, people have to fake it to make it. I knew that the application procession was broken to begin with, but I didn't want to admit it. Now im forced to see this horrendous rendition unfold before my eyes. Will I do the assessment? I have my doubt's, what's the fucking point of this anyway. I could just strive for target, I mean I have a friend who works there. $15/ hour , that's more than enough to buy people the stuff they want. 

Why? I ask myself
Why does an assessment matter?
Why did I waste my time coming here if this was the result that I would be greeted with?
Why did I have high hopes?
Why did I abandon what truly matters to me for something feasible and unfulfilling?

I just need to switch for the time being, because my digust for Burlington is long overdue. Today I have wasted, but when I think about it deeply these past few months up to now have been wasted. My progress has stagnated. I just need a decent paying job to fulfill my needs of investing, travelling and saving for the future.

Fuck it, I'll do the assessment, but in the meantime i'll give target a call. I simply need a place that at least pays the minimum of $11 an hour, maybe then I'll be good. I have so many fucking things that i want to express and it almost feels like my fucking Brain will explode. Its a good thing writing enables me to capture my raw unedited thoughts. What a fucking day and guess what, even if I do the interview they are going to bitch about we have to take a week to review your fucking application. If I take crash seriously from now, I am certain that I can get s job by next week. Man fuck this dialer too. Not all my contacts show up and the names dont even fucking pop up.
Maybe fucking sim 1 will offer the fix instead of Sim 2
